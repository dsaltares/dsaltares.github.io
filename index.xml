      <description>My friend Jay and I recently took part in Godot Wild Jam, a week long game jam where entries must be made using Godot Engine.
We had an absolute blast! The result is Plague, a procedurally generated action platformer. You can play it in the browser and use either a gamepad or keyboard!

      <description>This weekend FOSDEM 2020 will take place in Brussels. FOSDEM is a yearly conference about open source software. It&amp;rsquo;s totally free and no registration is required. As a consequence, it&amp;rsquo;s massive and chaotic, but also a lot of fun! I attended in 2017 and loved it, so I really look forward to this year&amp;rsquo;s edition.
If this is your first time, here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips that may come in handy.</description>

      <description>I had been using a DigitalOcean droplet to host this blog and personal projects for years. But&amp;hellip; Do I really need to spend the $6/month? It&amp;rsquo;s just a static Hugo site, which Github pages can do for free. Game hosting on itch.io is also free, it even gives you a mechanism to embed your web games. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;d be sorted!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple CD workflow for deploying a Huge site to Github pages.</description>

      <description>.Get &#34;linkText&#34;   Onederful Wizard is a puzzle action game where a little wizard goes from room to room defeating monsters with a single fireball.
The theme of the game jam was &amp;ldquo;Only One&amp;rdquo;, so we created a game where you have only one shot to solve all the puzzles and defeat all the enemies. After casting the spell, you will have to go a fetch it again so you can keep going.</description>

      <title>Run automated tests for your Godot game on CI</title>

      <description>Automated testing in gamedev Nowadays, most people agree that automated testing is absolutely crucial for all software development. Not so much when it comes to games development though. I still believe that the games industry would be able to iterate and ship faster by introducing unit and integration testing in the right places.
Godot and Gut Butch Wesley appears to be onboard, considering he created Gut, an automated testing framework for the Godot Game Engine.</description>

      <description>PyCon ES 2017 was an absolute blast!
The talks were very interesting and they&amp;rsquo;re all freely available on their Youtube channel.
Celebrating PyCon ES 2017 in Caceres, located in southern Spain, was a great choice. Beautiful medieval city center where some scenes in Game of Thrones were filmed, plus cheap and delicious food.

      <description>JSConf EU is one of the biggest JS conferences in Europe and I was lucky enough to attend its 2017 edition earlier this month. This year the event took place in Arena Berlin, a place by the river, typically dedicated to concerts in the east side of the German capital.
Overall, it was a pretty awesome weekend and although I wish there were more talks on advanced technical topics, I understand the event is more focused on community and diversity.</description>

      <description>Ludum Dare 38 starts in a couple of hours. This one is special as it marks the 15th anniversary of the biggest weekend game development friendly competition in the world!
If you don&amp;rsquo;t know about Ludum Dare and are interested, check the documentary they just released.
I was thinking of participating using Godot Engine. I have a couple of social compromises this weekend and, honestly, I am a bit scared of failing miserably, so I&amp;rsquo;m not too sure how far I&amp;rsquo;ll take this one.</description>

      <description>Two weekends ago I attended FOSDEM in Brussels for the first time and it was awesome. FOSDEM is a free conference about software development and open source with no registration required. Just show up, meet the community and learn new things.
Here are my highlights.
Planning With over 8k developers, 600 talks and 50 tracks spread across the university campus, planning is essential. Popular talks would fill up the rooms very early and the best option was to attend the previous one and get a spot in advance.</description>

      <title>Trying Godot Engine out for the #godotjam</title>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/trying-godot-engine-out-for-the-godotjam/</guid>
      <description>Godot Engine caught my eye a while back as a serious open source alternative to the ubiquitous Unity. Some of you may know I&amp;rsquo;ve been involved with the Libgdx project for some time, I even wrote a book about it!
There&amp;rsquo;s nothing wrong with Libgdx, I absolutely love the project and the more than welcoming community around it.
The problem is that shipping a game is hard. Doing so whilst working a full time job is harder.</description>

      <description>At long last, I got around to do something I had been meaning to do for a very long time. I migrated this Wordpress blog over to a statically generated site powered by Hugo.
That&amp;rsquo;s 6 years or over 300 posts worth of content.
Why not stay with Wordpress? First of all, I wanted to move away from Wordpress because it&amp;rsquo;s heavy and requires quite a bit of setup: PHP, database, plugins and so on.</description>

      <title>Built-in console for Libgdx games</title>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/built-in-console-for-libgdx-games/</guid>
      <description>A lot of games come with a built-in console that lets you enter commands, which is especially useful during development. Most times, it gets disabled before shipping although, occasionally, devs let you bring it up and enter cheat codes. CryEngine comes with a built-in console.
When you&amp;quot;re testing a new feature you just wrote, it can be incredibly useful to pause, reset the scene, teleport your character, become invincible, switch to a different level or even adjust some parameters in the AI.</description>

      <title>2D vision system with Ashley and Box2D</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/games/2d-vision-system-with-ashley-and-box2d/</link>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/2d-vision-system-with-ashley-and-box2d/</guid>
      <description>In Sloppynauts the player had to remain undetected, avoiding CCTV cameras and alien baddies. We constantly had to determine who could see who and whether the player was hidden behind something. We wrote a nice reusable system using Ashley and Box2D and I think it&amp;quot;d be a shame if it went to waste. So here it is in case you&amp;quot;d like to use it.
This 2D vision system is generic enough to work with both side-scrolling and top-down games.</description>

      <description>After a crazy weekend before the deadline, we finally managed to put something playable together for LibGDXJAM.
We&amp;quot;d love you to have a go, and leave some feedback.
We are definitely aware of the shortcomings of the game. We spent a lot of the jam working on a custom Overlap2D level loader and not so much on actual content, so you can actually finish the game in under a minute. I guess the difficulty (or lack of readability) may make it slightly longer, which is also a bit bad.</description>

      <description>Oh my God, enter panic mode, just 8 days left until the #LibGDXJAM deadline! We&amp;rsquo;ve been hard at work, especially @DrillerDev who&amp;rsquo;s pushed the character design and animation.
Look at this bad boy for instance, better not to mess with his alien gun.
Or the beholder powered alien surveillance.
Please, ignore the placeholder environment art, it&amp;rsquo;s the textures from the Overlap2D example project. Our chubby astronaut can run, crouch, jump and push boxes around.</description>

Here&amp;rsquo;s a few updates.
 @DrillerDev as joined us as an artist and has already produced some awesome concepts. Alberto and I have been working on an Overlap2D scene loader and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty much working supporting a bunch of things: composites, textures, lights, physics and particles. We have a somewhat buggy physics based platformer movement system.</description>

The theme is Life in Space and I&amp;quot;m teaming up with Alberto for #libGDXJAM and here&amp;rsquo;s our idea:
 Abe&amp;rsquo;s Oddysee meets This War of Mine meets Boogerman&amp;hellip; in space!
 A bunch of dangerously unprepared astronauts land on a strange planet only to find out it&amp;rsquo;s inhabited by big fat angry aliens with guns.</description>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/thoughts-on-unit-testing-for-ashley-and-games-in-general/</guid>
      <description>Shortly after we moved Ashley into the Libgdx family, we started writing unit tests for every single component in the framework using jUnit.
Unit testing goodness That was over a year and a half ago and it has proven to be a huge win for many reasons.
 Issue reporters can (and should) include a test that breaks as a way of explaining the problem. We can then easily include it into the suite, fix it and prevent future regressions.</description>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/projects/ashley-1-7-0-released/</guid>
      <description>There&amp;rsquo;s a new Ashley release, check the changes for 1.7.0 below:
 API change: removed UUIDs from entities, users should implement their own ID system when needed. This helps with networked games. Update: components are added/removed immediately, listeners are notified after the current system finishes updating. Bug fix: fixed entity listeners not being called if a component is added inside another listener. Bug fix: does not allocate memory inside updateFamilyMembership(). Update: uses Libgdx 1.</description>

Motivation When learning a new language, it is very common to struggle with verb conjugations. For example:
 I want to know the third person singular form (masculine) of the future perfect tense of the verb to eat in French.

      <guid>https://saltares.com/projects/ashley-1-6-0-released/</guid>
      <description>A new Ashley package has shipped, making 1.6.0 the latest stable version. Here&amp;rsquo;s the summary of the changes:
 API change: Component is now an interface. API addition: adds getEngine() to EntitySystem. API addition: EntityListeners now are notified by priority order. API consistency: defines what happens when an Entity is added twice to an Engine and when we try do nested updates. We throw an exception in both cases. API consistency: adding an EntitySystem of the same class twice replaces the previous one, just like it has always happened when adding Components to an Entity.</description>

The event had a great turnout and my talk seemed to have been well received. Moreover, I also got to meet cool people IRL such as Adrian, the guy behind the Artemis ECS.
For those who missed it and would like to watch me ramble about how brilliant Libgdx is for a whole 20 minutes, here is the video.</description>

Quick update to inform you that I just updated the samples repository to use Libgdx 1.6.0 and Ashley 1.5.0, both recently released.
Libgdx 1.6.0 introduces changes in our font rendering API, which require a few minor tweaks to the framework calls, nothing major.
7 months after the release of the book, we continue to support it. Rest assured, it is the most up to date Libgdx publication at this point in time.</description>

      <description>Thanks to the contributors, here&amp;rsquo;s a new version of Ashley, which now stands at 1.5.0. A new version of your favorite component based entity framework is out.
The version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.
 API addition: adds getFamily() method to IntervalIteratingSystem and IteratingSystem. API change: IntervalSystem‘s update() method is now final, as it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense to override it.</description>

Unfortunately, I&amp;rsquo;m no longer 16 years old, so the domain felt a bit dated. A change was long overdue, but I can be real lazy during the weekend. Finally I got around to do a proper migration of both domain name and hosting.
Welcome to saltares.com!

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a few months since Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook came out. Quite a few things have happened since then in the Libgdx world, libraries are updated and some things break over time.
As promised, we have updated our samples repository to use the latest versions of Libgdx (1.5.5), Ashley (1.4.0), gdx-ai (1.5.0) and RoboVM (1.0.0) among others. Luckily enough, only a few changes were necessary to make everything work again.</description>

      <description>A new version of Ashley, your favourite component based entity framework is out. The 1.4.0 version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.
 API deprecation: finallt removed the Family.getFor() methods. In order to retrieve a family, you can do Family.all().one().exclude().get(). API change: makes family Builder package protected. Bug fix: EntityOperation and ComponentOperation are now properly reset when put back into their pools.</description>

      <description>This story really upset me, but let&amp;rsquo;s start from the beginning for context&amp;rsquo;s sake.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been following Chris Hildenbrand&amp;rsquo;s blog 2D Game Art for Programmers since the very beginning because it&amp;rsquo;s absolutely amazing. He gives hope to talentless and desperate programmers like me, so we can go and make games that won&amp;rsquo;t make people want to pull their eyes out. Just a few intelligently placed shapes, some smart shading and you&amp;rsquo;ve got decent art.</description>

Things won&amp;rsquo;t get too technical, I&amp;rsquo;ll introduce the framework, explain why it&amp;rsquo;s so awesome, show who is currently using it in commercial products and give a quick demo at the end. Of course I won&amp;rsquo;t miss this golden opportunity to cheekily mention my Libgdx Cookbook!

      <description>As you can see, Ashley development has slowed down a bit. I would like to think it&amp;rsquo;s because we have a feature rich and stable framework rather than people having lost interest! Anyhow, there&amp;rsquo;s still been quite a bit of progress, enough to warrant a new release.
Ashley 1.3.3 is now out.
 API addition: added getEntity() method to Engine, it is now possible to retrieve entities by their ID. This will ease networked entity systems.</description>

      <description>While doing some cleanup of old feature branches, I accidentally deleted one that hadn&amp;rsquo;t been pushed to origin yet. However, I didn&amp;rsquo;t realise at the time.
After a couple of weeks, a hundred commits and many other branches mingling about, I found myself looking for the one I had previously deleted.
 Oh noes!
 Luckily for me, Git is somewhat idiot-proof and rarely truly deletes anything. Using git reflog you can list the tip of branches, including the deleted ones.</description>

      <description>The Google Nexus product line has always been the reference when it came to affordable high end smartphones. However, that seems to have changed a couple of days ago, the second the Nexus 6 was announced with a starting price tag of $649. Let us not forget that one could get a Nexus 5 for only $349.
As many have pointed out, this is most likely Google&amp;rsquo;s response to the pressure other vendors have put on the former.</description>

 API addition: adds IntervalSystem and IntervalIteratingSystem, which are updated at a fixed interval. API addition: adds getEntities() to IteratingSystem and IntervalIteratingSystem. API change: entities use long as ID. Changes entity.getIndex() for entity.getId(). Ids are reset to 0 after the entity is removed from the engine.</description>

      <description>As I have mentioned before, I have been working on a book titled Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook, which is set to be released next month.
Me and my co-author Alberto used a Git repository throughout the text and sample code development process. Using Gource, I have created a video that illustrates the repository&amp;rsquo;s evolution. Neat, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
  For those interested, here are the options I used.

      <title>Ashley 1.2.0 released</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/projects/ashley-1-2-0-released/</link>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/projects/ashley-1-2-0-released/</guid>
      <description>There have been quite a few things happening in Ashley during the past month, enough to call for a brand new release. Ashley 1.2.0 can now be fetched from Maven Central and this is what you&amp;rsquo;ll find new.
 API addition: people requested to put Entity#getComponent(Class) back in, so we accepted SgtCODFish‘s PR. ComponentMapper is still the most efficient and encouraged method to retrieve an entity&amp;rsquo;s components. API addition: added PooledEngine#clearPools() to delete unused entity and component pool memory.</description>

      <title>Ashley 1.1.0 released</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/projects/ashley-1-1-0-released/</link>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/projects/ashley-1-1-0-released/</guid>
      <description>Just under a month of the first official release we are ready to release a new stable version: Ashley 1.1.0. Here is the list of changes.
 Performance improvements: massive performance gains with O(1) component retrieval through ComponentMapper and the use of Array&amp;lt;Entity&amp;gt; rather than IntMap&amp;lt;Entity&amp;gt;. Unfortunately this changes the API slightly, but hopefully you guys will appreciate the benefits. Complete Ashley manual: now the wiki has a lot more content, it fully covers Ashley.</description>

      <description>Ashley now has a logo and it&amp;rsquo;s awesome! What an amazing contribution.
This is really good news because Ashley lacked an image to make it a bit more memorable. Now back to work, there will soon be a new release. Despite it involving some API changes, it will make for a much faster framework.</description>

      <description>Ashley, your favourite entity framework now has online javadocs and a wiki.
 Wooohooo!
 The javadocs correspond to the latest repository snapshot. Our Jenkins instance grabs the code, runs the tests, builds the jars and publishes the javadocs to the badlogic.com server. Kudos to Mario for the setup.
I just started putting stuff into the wiki yesterday so it&amp;rsquo;s pretty empty as of now. Expect more content soon!</description>

      <description>Ashley Super Jumper has been my weekend project. It is nothing more than a clone of the Libgdx demo game. The catch is that it goes for an entity system approach rather than the classic inheritance model. Naturally, it uses Ashley.
The point was to have a reference project folks could check out in order to understand how entity systems in general and Ashley in particular work.
Maybe one day, I&amp;rsquo;ll post a proper article explaining the design behind the entity systems at play in Super Jumper.</description>

      <description>Last night I added Ashley support to the official Libgdx setup tool. Creating Libgdx projects that use Ashley entity framework is now even easier. Simply make sure you tick the Ashley checkbox before generating your project.
By the way, if you already have a a project, adding the extra dependency is also trivial.
 Core project: com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1 Android project: com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1 GWT project: com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1:sources  Remember that using Ashley in non Libgdx projects is also perfectly fine.</description>

It might have been possible to say that 5 years can make a blog be referred to as veteran. If we were in 2010.</description>

      <description>Finally! During the past couple of months me and a bunch of awesome collaborators have been working on a proper Ashley release and now it&amp;rsquo;s done. Here is the list of the new shiny features.
Mind that some of them break the previous API. However, this is our first official release, we&amp;rsquo;ll push hard to keep the API backwards compatible from now on.
 Gradle: we got rid of the Eclipse projects and now use Gradle to manage our dependencies and build process.</description>

      <description>Loads of stuff in the pipeline lately: new job, finishing my book and some Ashley development. What? You don&amp;rsquo;t know what Ashley is? Here is a brief, straight from GitHub.
 A tiny entity framework written in Java. It&amp;rsquo;s inspired by frameworks like Ash (hence the name) and Artemis. Ashley tries to be a high-performance entity framework without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy and transparent to use.</description>

      <description>Almost a year ago, I started working on a Libgdx recipe book with Alberto Cejas, an old University mate. Now, Packt Publishing, have announced the project on their website, Libgdx Cross-platform Development Cookbook.
You can even pre-order a printed copy or the e-book version (DRM free).
Exciting times!
The book offers step-by-step guides on how to master Libgdx subsystems to build 2D games that run almost everywhere: Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers.</description>

Without further ado, I&amp;rsquo;ll let you see how awesome it looks.</description>

      <description>At last! The game I worked on during my 2 years at Crytek UK has been announced with an amazing trailer. Big congratulations at the Nottingham team for the huge effort put into this project. What a bunch of incredibly talented people, I&amp;rsquo;m really honoured to have been part of the project.
I mainly worked on emergent AI systems for NPCs and animation. Unfortunately, you cannot see much of that on this trailer.</description>

      <description>As I mentioned here a few days ago, last weekend I entered the 29th edition of the Ludum Dare game jam, which had Beneath the surface as a theme. To be completely honest, I was only bothered to work on the project for about 4 hours each day. That probably explains why is my worst game jam entry so far.
Beneath the surface is a very simple, classic text adventure where the player needs to escape an underground cave by using commands in the form of verb object like:</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m up for Ludum Dare despite not being too sure about whether or not I&amp;rsquo;ll be able to invest enough time on it. The last couple of editions eluded me, so I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to miss yet another one.
Given the time constraints, I might even go for just a text adventure. Or maybe not, who knows. I&amp;rsquo;ll decide in the morning, once the theme is announced!

      <description>Important: variadic templates are only available from C++11, make sure your compiler supports it.
Who has never used the Observer pattern? As long as you have been involved in any medium sized project, chances are you have come across it at some point.
The problem It is extremely common to have an event generating system other components would like to subscribe to. However, oftentimes I see code to manage a collection of listeners being unnecessarily duplicated on a per system basis.</description>

I would dare to say it was well received. A zero total count of rotten tomatoes thrown at me shall be good enough of an indicator to back up my previous statement.</description>

The talk will focus on how open source projects help you get into the industry, which is something I&amp;rsquo;ve been writing about lately. But I guess I&amp;rsquo;ll end up talking about tangential matters such as student life as well as my experience at Crytek and Sony.</description>

      <description>Don&amp;rsquo;t exactly remember how, but last night I came across Code Analyzer, an open source Java desktop utility that counts lines of code. Out of curiosity, I downloaded the runnable jar file and tried it with Libgdx.
I was very much aware that Libgdx was a pretty big project but certainly didn&amp;rsquo;t expect it to be that large. At the time of writing the HEAD of the repository contains 1.048.646 lines of Java, C and C++.</description>

Have you thought about contributing back?
 Who, me?
 Yes and here&amp;rsquo;s why.
So much win The beauty of a healthy community driven project such as Libgdx is that decisions are crowd-sourced and code is always peer reviewed.</description>

      <description>Fix your Timestep is a fantastic article by Glenn Fiedler that explains the different ways to tick a physics simulation. Show some self-respect, go read it and check some of his other articles on physics and network code. Some might be 8 years old but still totally relevant.
Essentially, it covers different approaches to pick a delta value to pass through to the physics engine along their strengths and weaknesses. The topic is complex but has an undeniable impact on games&amp;rsquo; behaviour.</description>

      <description>Today I created a repository on Gihub to keep track of my code base and I named it SionCore. This wasn&amp;rsquo;t made overnight, it&amp;rsquo;s the result of several small game projects, such as game jam gigs and Math Maze.
Slowly, it became obvious that some components were highly reusable and game agnostic. That is why I thought it would be good to make it public.

      <guid>https://saltares.com/computing/using-ant-behind-a-proxy/</guid>
      <description>Many Java projects use Ant to automate their build process. Libgdx, for instance, is among them. One could possibly say Ant is the Java version of Make. Targets, dependencies and other settings are defined in XML scripts.
Downloading dependencies while your machine is behind a proxy might prove problematic. Luckily enough, you can specify your proxy settings inside the Ant script.
&amp;lt;setproxy proxyhost=&amp;quot;host&amp;quot; proxyport=&amp;quot;port&amp;quot; proxypassword=&amp;quot;password&amp;quot;/&amp;gt; Users behind a proxy would now be able to download dependencies with Ant.</description>

Truth be told, over the years, standard after standard, C++ has become a behemoth of a language. As Scott Meyers likes to say, it&amp;rsquo;s actually a set of languages.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s been almost a full quarter since the last blog post, shame on me! How could I dare commit such outrageous atrocity, right? To be completely honest with you, I hadn´t been so busy in a very long time.
In a spark of madness, after Math Maze was done, I partnered with a publisher to start writing a game development book. Let me tell you right now, combining a full time job and a side project full of deadlines is a hazardous cocktail ready to blow up in your face, making you require serious reconstructive surgery.</description>

      <description>After approximately 5 months of work, Math Maze went live on Google Play on September the 2nd, so I thought a little postmortem was in order. For those who are not aware, Math Maze is a very simple brain teaser math based game.
The player has to move a purple block across a labyrinth towards the exit. However, there are numerical conditions blocking the way. In order to traverse them, the purple block has to combine itself with operations.</description>

      <description>Just a quick update this time. A while back I mentioned that I had been doing some technical reviewing on a LibGDX book, and now it&amp;rsquo;s finally out.
Learning LibGDX Game Development by Andreas Oehlke explains the basic features of the mighty framework whilst building a simple platformer from scratch. Even though it isn&amp;rsquo;t an advanced read, it&amp;quot;ll surely help whoever doesn&amp;rsquo;t have a huge deal of experience in games development and wants to give LibGDX a try.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m pleased to say that Math Maze 1.3 is finally out on Google Play. This release has quite some more juice than the other ones as it&amp;rsquo;s the first to feature new content. Here&amp;rsquo;s the complete list of changes.
 5 new levels (total of 40) including the new % operator. Polish locale thanks to my friend Konrad. Bug fixes (first one I found post release!)  The module operator gives the remainder of the division and it&amp;rsquo;s pretty cool because it allows me to add a new layer of complexity to level design.</description>

      <description>I released Math Maze 4 days ago and, even though it&amp;rsquo;s not on any top list of any kind, I&amp;quot;m getting loads of positive feedback through Twitter and Google Play itself. Only 17 ratings but averaging a total of 4.9 stars. Some of the comments might not even come from family nor friends! Impressive, isn&amp;rsquo;t it?
My intent was to make changes as per user feedback and so, today, Math Maze 1.</description>

      <description>Oh my… The posting rate has dangerously decreased lately! Before you judge, know that there are a couple of very good reasons for it. First and foremost, I&amp;quot;m on holiday, back in Cádiz, my hometown to enjoy a little bit of sun and work on my tan. It&amp;rsquo;s a small charming beautiful city with amazing beaches and prohibitively delicious places to eat .
 Fun fact: its 3000 years of history make it the oldest city in southwestern Europe.</description>

Titled Learning libGDX Game Development, goes through all the basic features while building a multi-platform project from scratch.
Andreas Oelhke, author, has done what I believe to be a pretty good job, mostly thanks to the incredibly practical approach he&amp;rsquo;s taken.</description>

While that might very well be a whole post on its own, I want to focus on Tim Sweeney&amp;ldquo;s interview on the past and future of Unreal Engine and Epic Games. More specifically, on the fact that they&amp;quot;ll be dropping their widely used scripting language entirely towards Unreal 4.</description>

      <description>Most of my spare time for the last month or so has gone to an Android pet project, which partially explains the lack of activity around here. However, such project gave me a little idea for a short tutorial flavoured article.
Level design, practically a synonym of iteration Everybody knows how essential iteration is for games development. Ideas tend to look awesome on paper, yet most of them perform poorly when implemented.</description>

      <description>That I know of…
For those who don&amp;rsquo;t know, Freegemas was my first libgdx project, which I made in a couple of weeks to learn how to use the framework. Actually, I&amp;quot;m not to take the credit as it&amp;rsquo;s a silly Java/libgdx port of a game made by an university mate, José Tomás Tocino. Freegemas was originally written in C++ using Gosu and both versions were open sourced under the GPL license.</description>

      <description>Very early this morning, and after 20 days of voting, Ludum Dare #26 came to an end, giving way to the much anticipated final results.
How did I do? Without further ado, these are the scores for Lightbyrinth compared to those of my previous entry.
Despite the obvious room for improvement, I&amp;quot;m quite happy with these results.
Primarily, my performance compared to that of #LD24 has seen a significant increase in the most relevant categories, Whoooh!</description>

      <description>Games are resource intensive applications in terms of both memory and CPU time. Offtimes it&amp;rsquo;s necessary to render hundreds of different sprites on screen whilst playing and manipulating dozens of sound effects samples. Logically, those assets need to be stored in memory and such precious elixir doesn&amp;rsquo;t come for free.
Fair enough, you can probably afford to brainlessly waste some memory on PC when working on small projects but in the world of mobile devices is just the complete opposite.</description>

      <description>Last weekend was as sleep depriving as rewarding. While I could have easily been surrounded by the joys of procrastination and beer, I went for Ludum Dare #26, as announced in my previous post. Lightbyrinth is the result of that and, despite its flaws, I&amp;quot;m fairly happy with the outcome. Please don&amp;rsquo;t embarrass me by looking at the source, I was in a 48 hour rush.
Lightbyrinth is a light based maze which tries to stick to the &amp;ldquo;Minismalism&amp;rdquo; democratically voted theme.</description>

However, unless something major happens, I&amp;quot;m totally in for Ludum Dare #26 which will take place next weekend. Aiming at respecting tradition I shall post my arsenal of choice, unsurprisingly, they are as follow.

      <description>Open source is sometimes much more than just coding and committing to the most trendy repository at that point in time. It&amp;rsquo;s also about the community. When a piece of software grows, stops being a pet project and makes a certain impact, it is to be expected to see people flocking around it. Who knows, even other developers could start contributing via pull requests, documentation or support in your forums.</description>

      <description>As of today, I truly believe libgdx to be the best open source cross platform games framework when it comes to 2D. As if desktop, Android and iOS were not enough, it also comes with a WebGL backend. Luckily enough, this does not force you to maintain a Javascript version of your game code. Instead, it relies on Google Web Toolkit (GWT), which translates your Java project into optimized, obfuscated Javascript code.</description>

They kindly asked some people from Crytek and Rockstar to do the judging and provide the students with some advice during the competition. Waking up early during the weekend is never ideal but hey, those students were about to pull an allnighter! It&amp;quot;d have been really inconsiderate not to show up.</description>

      <description>It pleases me to say that this past week I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to keep it real and stick to my humble set of tasks:
Victory and defeat mechanic: the spaceship has a limited amount of energy which diminishes after each collision with the world geometry. Once it&amp;rsquo;s empty, the game enters the defeat state and restarts. If the player manages to abduct all the astronauts in the level, the game goes into the victory state.</description>

      <description>This hasn&amp;rsquo;t been a particularly productive week for my One Game a Month quest. Luckily enough, it wasn&amp;rsquo;t completely wasted as some stuff has, indeed, been done. Coding after work and taking care of so many other things it&amp;rsquo;s unsurprisingly tough. I&amp;quot;m still looking for that guy who sells hours, so I can append them to a regular day.
Except for the art, I pretty much did everything I promised. Actually, it&amp;rsquo;s better if I make a game first and then worry about the art, as I learned from my Ludum Dare experience.</description>

I believe, it&amp;rsquo;s time to report back with the work I&amp;rsquo;ve done during the past seven days.

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s February already! What kind of madness is this? Anyhow, that means it&amp;rsquo;s time to start working on this month&amp;rsquo;s entry for One Game A Month without further ado. This time I promise not to shamelessly make a port of an existing game and go for a brand new project instead. Shall this initial design article serve as the compromise I&amp;quot;m making to see this game to completion.
I believe the following game concept to be simple enough for it to be achievable within a short month like February.</description>

      <description>I bet you already know that keeping memory allocation under control in real time applications is absolutely essential. Bad memory management in non garbage collected languages, say C++, results in irresponsible footprints. $deity forbid we incur in a std::bad_alloc exception! That can be a deal breaker for mobile phones or consoles. However, the other family of languages is what really haunts me. In Java, for instance, the consequences of not giving a monkey&amp;rsquo;s about memory won&amp;rsquo;t necessarily make your game crash.</description>

 Well yes, so deal with it.
Life is hard for us programmers, who can&amp;rsquo;t always find a committed artist (rare species) to work with in our projects. Yet we stand as heroes, eager to create games. It saddens me how often we see ourselves forced to produce low quality assets, I&amp;quot;d never call that art.</description>

      <description>Your quest is to try to create one new game each month. This challenge is meant to help you on a personal level. There are no prizes, signup fees or rules. It might sound crazy optimistic, but you CAN do it.
 These are the opening lines on the One Game A Month website, an initiative by Christer Kaitila aka @McFunckypants (author of The Game Jam Survival Guide). I came across this insane quest just over a week ago and I&amp;rsquo;ve given it a lot of thought before accepting it.</description>

      <description>Creative people usually make a big deal out of authorship and honestly, who can blame us? We&amp;quot;re passionate about our work! Producing something that doesn&amp;rsquo;t entirely suck entails sweat, tears and numerous sleepless nights. The open source world is inherently tricky and raises many concerns regarding ownership.
Open source is a tradeoff The story of our lives isn&amp;rsquo;t it? Making your project open source is a tradeoff. On one hand you are more likely to achieve certain level of exposure.</description>

      <title>New to games? Just make games</title>

      <description>Disclaimer: this text is aimed at games programming beginners.
Diving into games development for the first time is exciting but offtimes confusing, a great piece of advice would be: just make games. Get things done, period. I&amp;rsquo;ve often found myself researching which available technology would suit my requirements best, as if I needed a sophisticated tailored tuxedo. The fear of finding a dead end was as powerful as counterproductive. Such a time wasting approach.</description>

      <description>A friend recently asked me about which either general or games specific programming books would I recommend. The true and legendary must read. I answered him directly as I was feeling lazy about posting a comment on each one of them but here I am now. Nevertheless, before going straight to the list, please bare in mind that just like any other best of [insert year here] collection, this is simply a matter of opinion.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been to Spain, not only to spend some quality time with family and friends but to deliver a presentation at my home University. It was basically about how the Games Industry work, how we make games at Crytek UK and what should a Computing Science student do in order to find a job in such a field. Anyways, it was quite nice coming back to where all this began and I&amp;quot;d like to thank my professor Manuel Palomo for making this possible.</description>

      <description>Update: the system had been moved into the official libgdx repository as an extension but then it was removed. Gleed doesn&amp;rsquo;t support basic features such as relative paths for textures.
I&amp;quot;m happy to announce that I&amp;rsquo;ve made my first contribution to a relatively big open source project. I feel honoured to contribute to the brilliant libgdx framework with these humble loader and renderer for GLEED2D levels. Hold on, what the hell is that?</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a busy bee lately but here it comes yet another post with a piece of not so relevant news related to my projects.
Even though I&amp;rsquo;ve always been kind of sceptical about GitHub, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally decided to migrate most of my projects. After getting a bit deeper into the libgdx community over there, I&amp;rsquo;ve come to see the benefits of this self proclaimed social coding platform. Forking, pulling and giving/receiving feedback is easy and motivating (kind of a must when working on side projects).</description>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/projects/id-generator-avoiding-string-comparisons/</guid>
      <description>Disclaimer: IDGenerator is being used in SionEngine and it&amp;rsquo;s an useful but rather simple approach to the problem described in the paragraphs below.
Needless to say that in games development we care very much about performance. It becomes an even more critical issue when we&amp;quot;re dealing with non native languages such as Python, C# or Java (being the later my case in these dire times). One of the countless things that can negatively impact performance in games are strings comparisons.</description>

      <title>Abstracting platform specific code in libgdx</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/games/abstracting-platform-specific-code-in-libgdx/</link>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/abstracting-platform-specific-code-in-libgdx/</guid>
      <description>One of the main reasons I&amp;quot;m working with libgdx is its multiplatform capabilities. With very little effort you can target desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Android and WebGL able browsers. The problem comes with the &amp;ldquo;little&amp;rdquo; in the previous sentence. The developer is supposed to share the code base between all targets but sometimes it&amp;quot;s necessary to provide platform specific behaviour, maybe because a feature is not available in every device or just to adapt the product better to the target.</description>

      <description>Note: I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to remove the repo for now as I feel that it&amp;rsquo;s still too rough around the edges. Other open source projects that share this codebase are, however, available on my GitHub profile.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been working with libgdx for a few months now and I love every aspect of it, except maybe the fact that it&amp;rsquo;s only compatible with Java but don&amp;rsquo;t worry about me, I&amp;quot;ll survive. Being able to target desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Android and HTML5 with very little effort it&amp;rsquo;s just too awesome.</description>

      <description>Play the game! Ludum Dare #24 is over after an exhausting crazy weekend but, above all, it´s been a ton of fun. Joining the Dare has proven to be an excellent idea and I believe it&amp;quot;d be right to say it&amp;rsquo;s has not gone too bad after all, considering it was my first time. Here&amp;rsquo;s a little postmortem on the experience.
Evolution – The survival of the fittest The competition&amp;rsquo;s theme was Evolution so I went for a classic 2D platformer starred by a funny caveman who has to get through the level while killing dinosaurs by jumping on them or throwing rocks which he collects himself.</description>

Pick the tools of your choice but everything has to be made from scratch, and according to a theme selected by the community through strict democracy. Last edition got over 1000 submissions, so it looks really promising. I&amp;quot;m gathering with a couple of friends from work in some sort of LAN game jamming party and there will be food aplenty, fun times.</description>

 I recently watched with a few friends Indie Game: The Movie, a documentary that shows the development process of a few independent small budget games and what drives their authors to work in such a competitive industry. I was fairly excited about watching it since the trailer highlighted some of the reasons I chose this career path.</description>

      <description>A few months ago I developed Urban Race, a very simple (and quite lame) time attack racing game using XNA. It was a University project so I couldn&amp;rsquo;t release the source until it was graded but then, I totally forgot about it. Recently, a reader asked me to publish the source and here we are. Please, bare in mind it&amp;rsquo;s for educational purposes, it was developed in one month without previous knowledge of neither C# or XNA and it&amp;rsquo;s not intended to be a fully playable product.</description>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/internationalization-for-libgdx-projects/</guid>
      <description>Warning: Libgdx now counts with localisation support, rendering this approach obsolete.
Edit: I just added UTF-8 support
Localization is a key aspect in games, specially if you want to reach a wider audience. I recently ported Freegemas to the libgdx platform and, as the original one, I wanted to ship it with multi-language support. There is no such a thing as gettext for Java and I didn&amp;rsquo;t see the Android internationalization system as a good fit in a multiplatform development.</description>

      <description>I can&amp;rsquo;t believe it&amp;rsquo;s been almost three months since I started at Crytek UK, time has passed amazingly fast! Nevertheless, I&amp;rsquo;ve managed to get some stuff done game development wise. I&amp;rsquo;ve always wanted to jump into mobile and that&amp;rsquo;s what I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing during the last couple of weeks. May I present you Freegemas libgdx edition!
It&amp;rsquo;s basically a libgdx port of the original Freegemas, a simple Bejeweled like C++ Gosu puzzle game developed by José Tomás Tocino who I have to thank for the neat original code and the excellent art.</description>

      <description>I can finally say it out loud: I just got hired by Crytek UK as a junior programmer! In case you were wondering, yes, they are the same guys that pulled the Crysis saga together using their jaw dropping CryEngine, and now they&amp;quot;re working on games like Homefront 2. Their British studio is based in Nottingham, so I moved here a couple of days ago and I really like the city so far.</description>

      <description>As if I didn&amp;rsquo;t have enough work, I recently started another project which has an early deadline. For the Advanced Games Programming module here at Kingston University we have to develop a game for Windows and Xbox 360 using C# and the XNA framework. The final deadline was in a month counting from the start date and, halfway through the development, we had to show a demo. That&amp;rsquo;s how Urban Race began just a week ago, in this post I&amp;quot;ll talk about the game and my first impressions on XNA.</description>

I know it&amp;rsquo;s not precisely pretty but at least the boids are moving in a nice way. It&amp;rsquo;s written in C++ using the despicable Open Scene Graph library (such an uncomfortable API).</description>

      <description>Yesterday I had an in class demo at university of my PSP First Person Shooter prototype, Evolve. The professor was impressed with the software engineering behind the system so, apparently, it went quite well although the project is in a very early stage of development. As always, I was in the games lab (it&amp;rsquo;s becoming my second home), so I recorded a video of the demo to keep track of the process.</description>

      <description>Just a quick update, you really should spend a few minutes watching this presentation. Johan Andersson, Rendering architech at DICE, gave a talk called &amp;ldquo;Shiny PC graphics in Battlefield 3&amp;rdquo; during the last nVidia GeForce LAN. It&amp;rsquo;s focused on the latest improvements the Frostbite 2 engine includes and I think it&amp;rsquo;s a pretty good example of where the graphics technology is going.

The deadline is settled in the middle of the semester, so that roughly gives me a couple of months which means a lot of hard work lies ahead, taking into account that it&amp;rsquo;s a completely new technology for me.

      <description>Life in Kingston goes on and it&amp;rsquo;s time to get some work done. Hope Caton, who was the plot writer in Tomb Raider IV and currently works as a teacher here at Kingston University, is organizing InKUbator. It&amp;rsquo;s a extra-curricular activity in which students can team up with the only goal of developing a great game. More on that in the following paragraphs.
InKUbator comes with extra sweetness since guest speakers from the games industry are coming.</description>

I was amazed with the huge amount of money they should invest to have proper facilities: a huge library, great fully equipped labs and comfortable classrooms. It&amp;amp;#8217;s unbelievable how active the people is around here, there are students societies for almost everything you can imagine: DJs, skydiving, fencing, cake eating, wine tasting, gaming, market investment&amp;amp;#8230; And the list goes on!</description>

I&amp;quot;m in Kingston Upon Thames (London) to study computing science and games development for a whole year with an Erasmus exchange scholarship. I arrived on September the 13th and since then, it&amp;rsquo;s been a nonstop of activities: tourism, paperwork, parties, meeting people, housework, etc. Finally I can sit for a while to write this.</description>

Es una de las culpables de la escasez de actividad pero en ella podréis encontrar recopilada y ampliada la documentación que he ido publicando en este blog.
Se explica como se han diseñado e implementado las características más importantes de Sion Tower y cómo se ha ideado la estructura de IberOgre.</description>

El resultado es una sencilla página web que contiene información sobre todas las clases, métodos y atributos del sistema. Espero que sea útil a aquel que desee comprender cómo funciona el juego de forma interna.
Poco a poco voy preparando el lanzamiento formal de la versión 1.</description>

Desplazando el ratón mientras se mantiene pulsado el botón derecho es posible hacer girar la cámara, con la rueda podemos acercarla o alejarla y, si nos movemos hará un seguimiento del personaje. También podéis ver un avance del segundo nivel del juego.</description>

En esta ocasión están disponibles Crayon Physics, Cogs, VVVVVV, Hammerfight y And Yet It Moves. La gracia de esta colección es que puedes pagar la cifra que desees, desde un mísero centavo de dólar (no seas tacaño) hasta los más de 4.</description>

      <description>Uno de los objetivos de IberOgre era proporcionar los conceptos mínimos de matemáticas para desarrollar juegos en 3D. Hasta ahora la sección creada a tal efecto estaba vacía pero lo he solucionado con la publicación de &amp;ldquo;Introducción, puntos y vectores&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Matrices&amp;rdquo; y &amp;ldquo;Cuaterniones&amp;rdquo;. No se llega mucho más allá de lo que uno haya podido aprender en el instituto pero el enfoque se enfoca especialmente al desarrollo de videojuegos.
En líneas generales los temas tratados son los siguientes:</description>

      <description>En este nuevo vídeo podéis ver la discreta pero funcional interfaz de Sion Tower. Está completamente creada utilizando MyGUI, una biblioteca muy sencilla pero no exenta de problemas de los que hablaré en el futuro. También podéis observar el nuevo sistema de apuntado. Mientras que antes el personaje lanzaba un hechizo hacia donde estuviese mirando, ahora podemos apuntar con el ratón. Al contar únicamente con ocho direcciones, era muy complicado acertar.</description>

      <description>Era algo que llevaba queriendo implementar en Sion Tower y finalmente he visto la oportunidad. Sion Tower estará disponible en varios idiomas gracias a la biblioteca libre de internacionalización gettext. Por el momento os puedo confirmar tres idiomas: español, inglés y francés. Sigue leyendo para conocer los detalles.
GNU gettext es prácticamente un estándar en la internacionalización de software. Hasta el momento lo había utilizado en gLapse pero estoy encantado con el sistema.</description>

      <description>Me gustaría pedir disculpas por el descenso en el ritmo de publicación, el motivo es muy sencillo: estoy trabajando de forma intensa en la interfaz de Sion Tower. Para el menú principal he creado un escenario montañoso con los enemigos aproximándose a la Torre Sagrada en medio de una intensa lluvia. Modelar las montañas con Blender es terriblemente sencillo una vez se conoce la técnica apropiada y aquí vamos a comentarla en detalle.</description>

      <description>Las últimas semanas he estado trabajando en la IA de Sion Tower y por el momento el resultado es satisfactorio. Antes utilizaba el algoritmo A para la búsqueda de caminos de los enemigos, pero me di cuenta de que el rendimiento podía ser mucho mejor si precomputaba las búsquedas con una alternativa como Floyd. En este artículo hablo de las dos aproximaciones y comparo los resultados obtenidos.
Aclaración: en el texto no voy a entrar en detalles sobre los algoritmos A* ni Floyd.</description>

Los podcasts me ayudan a que el tiempo pase a mayor velocidad mientras hago deporte así que devoro capítulos que da gusto y tengo que seguir varios programas. En esta segunda entrega recomendaré otro buen pack.

      <description>En este nuevo vídeo de Sion Tower podéis ver la inteligencia artificial de los enemigos en acción. Cuando un bicho feo aparece, utiliza el navigation mesh y la búsqueda de caminos para trazar una ruta hacia el personaje. Gracias a los steering behaviours siguedicho camino y evita colisiones con sus compañeros. En el momento en el que se acerca al protagonista, comienzan a atacar.
En los próximos artículos comentaré el funcionamiento del sistema.</description>

      <description>When you&amp;quot;re developing a game as a team, organization can be pretty challenging. You have to write code so every art asset fits in perfectly. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably used yourself ugly squares to represent some character&amp;rsquo;s sprite in early development stages but… What happens with audio? That&amp;rsquo;s when SFXR comes into play.
What is SFXR? SFXR is a simple sound effect prototyping open source tool. It was initially developed for the 10th Ludum Dare 48h gamedev competition.</description>

      <description>Tras la lamentable X-Men 3: The last stand, no tenía demasiadas esperanzas puestas en esta precuela. Sobre todo prescindiendo de todos los actores con cierto caché de episodios anteriores como Ian McKellen (Magneto), Patrick Stewart (Charles Xavier) o Hale Berry (Tormenta). Una licencia que vende y una reducción de presupuesto parecían los ingredientes idóneos para el enésimo truñaco. Nada más lejos de la realidad, X-Men: First class es una buena película de superhéroes.</description>

      <description>Several days ago I was a bit tired of working on IberOgre, the Spanish Ogre wiki so I started procrastinating. Then I discovered the Ludum Dare 48h game development competition and I was amazed about the idea. Lots of developers use to record their progress in time lapse videos to show how their mini games evolved. There are very good Windows tools to do that but on GNU/Linux systems you have to use command line scripts and that&amp;rsquo;s where gLapse comes into play.</description>

El protagonista puede lanzar hechizos de varios tipos que impactan con los elementos sólidos del escenario produciendo una pequeña explosión. Para los efectos visuales se utiliza el sistema de partículas de Ogre y, aunque aún queda margen para la mejora, el resultado es aceptable. Sion Tower cuenta con un sistema de audio 3D pero no se han incluido efectos ya que estoy a la espera del colaborador encargado de dicho apartado.</description>

      <description>Tras publicar varios artículos en IberOgre, he decidido retomar el trabajo en Sion Tower con el objetivo de tener una versión inicial a finales de julio. La primera tarea que he llevado a cabo es una refactorización del sistema de actores con el objetivo de hacerlo más extensible y evitar la duplicación de código en la medida de lo posible aunque crezca la verticalidad en la jerarquía. Por el momento no todas las clases están implementadas pero sí diseñadas.</description>

      <description>¡Se nota la actividad en IberOgre! He estado trabajando bastante duro estos días para sacar adelante un nuevo artículo: &amp;ldquo;Sistema de overlays&amp;rdquo;. En el texto se tratan en bastante profundidad los mecanismos que ofrece Ogre para desplegar paneles e indicadores 2D a modo de GUI o HUD.
Los contenidos que abarca se resumen en:
 Conceptos básicos: qué es un overlay y qué tipos existen. Estructura: clases que intervienen, sintaxis de los scripts, paneles, elementos y fuentes.</description>

Acudes a Softonic, tecleas &amp;ldquo;de .avi a iPod&amp;rdquo;, descargas el que más estrellas tiene, se instala sin preguntar la enésima barra del navegador, resulta que no funciona y además su interfaz es ultra compleja. Es más que probable que lo que busques sea YakiTo, uno de los mejores conversores que he probado. No, no lo digo porque su creador, Sergio García Mondaray, sea un compañero del V CUSL.</description>

En esta ocasión en &amp;ldquo;Sistemas de partículas&amp;rdquo; ofrecemos todos los conceptos necesarios para desplegar efectos especiales en nuestros videojuegos desarrollados con Ogre como destellos, humo, fuego y un largo etcétera.
A vista de pájaro, tratamos los siguientes puntos:
 Conceptos básicos sobre los sistemas de partículas. Estructura de un sistema de partículas: propiedades, Emitters y Afectors.</description>

      <description>Acabo de publicar un nuevo artículo en IberOgre titulado &amp;ldquo;Extender la gestión de recursos, audio&amp;rdquo;. Es un completo texto en el que se exponen todos los conocimientos necesarios para integrar los recursos de tu propio juego (niveles, audio, scripts de IA, etc) dentro del sistema de gestión de recursos de Ogre. La teoría se lleva a la práctica creando un sistema de audio sobre SDL, característica inexistente en Ogre de forma inicial.</description>

      <description>Un pequeño apunte, se acaba de publicar una entrevista que me hicieron en el blog Desarrolladores de videojuegos sobre IberOgre y Sion Tower. Se trata de una comunidad hispanohablante que publica artículos, tutoriales y mucho material relacionado con el desarrollo de videojuegos. Hablamos principalmente sobre la concepción y el desarrollo de mi proyecto actual aunque también tocamos temas como los juegos independientes o la formación. Quiero agradecerle a Epifanio Suárez su tiempo y el espacio que me ha concedido en su página, esto contribuirá a la difusión de IberOgre y Sion Tower.</description>

      <description>Como ya he comentado, mi equipo de trabajo está en el servicio técnico y con la escasa potencia de mi netbook se me hace prácticamente imposible desarrollar Sion Tower. Por tanto, he redirigido mis esfuerzos a IberOgre. Recientemente he publicado un artículo tratando de forma general el subsistema de materiales de Ogre. Espero que os sea útil, a continuación adjunto un pequeño sumario.
 Conceptos básicos: iluminación, color difuso, especular, texturas, shading… Materiales: scripts .</description>

      <description>El pasado día 13 de abril se lanzó la primera versión estable de la línea 2.5 de Blender (2.57), la herramienta de modelado y animación 3D libre por excelencia. Entre sus múltiples mejoras se encuentra el rediseño completo de la interfaz y la nueva API para Python. Es posible descargarlo para Linux desde la web pero lo más cómodo es instalarlo en Ubuntu es a través de un PPA y a continuación explico cómo hacerlo.</description>

Como su propio nombre indica, se hace un repaso sencillo pero completo por el subsistema de animación del famoso motor de renderizado 3D libre. Como siempre, se aceptan críticas constructivas y todo tipo de sugerencias que nos ayuden a mejorar.

      <description>En el Estudio Evergreen siguen componiendo música para el videojuego Sion Tower. En esta ocasión nos traen la pieza que sonará durante el segundo nivel. No podría estar más contento con su trabajo, es una melodía pegadiza que se ajusta perfectamente al espíritu de Sion Tower. Podéis escuchadla después del salto.
Daniel Pellicer y Antonio Caro ya estaban consiguiendo buenos resultados para la banda sonora pero no se han conformado y siguen queriendo aprender nuevas técnicas.</description>

Básicamente es una jornada llena de seminarios y talleres informales en el que todos los participantes deberían intervenir. Escribo este comentario por aquí para difundir un poco el evento y animar al personal a que se de una vuelta.
Una BarCamp tiene como principal punto fuerte que todo participante debería aportar algo en forma de actividad, comida o ayuda a la organización.</description>

Speedx 3D es de los que más gratas sensaciones me ha producido por su sencillez y adictiva mecánica. A continuación sigue un breve comentario sobre el juego.

En esta ocasión nos enseña el Gólem de hielo, uno de los enemigos más poderosos del videojuego. Para el diseño se ha basado en la correspondiente descripción que aparece en el documento de diseño:
 Una criatura de gran tamaño formada por bloques de hielo. Su avance es lento y pesado pero sus golpes son temibles.</description>

Por supuesto, me refiero a estados como &amp;ldquo;Juego&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Menú&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Selección de nivel&amp;rdquo;. Me parece interesante comentar a vista de pájaro estos estados así como el sistema subyacente que los gestiona. Puede ser una buena manera para saber hasta dónde pretende llegar el juego.

Pudisteis ver que el personaje recorría el camino de forma brusca, actualmente el problema se ha solucionado gracias a la inclusión de splines en una colaboración del compañero Javier Santacruz (@arld101). ¡La primera colaboración en forma de código! En este artículo nos centraremos en ilustrar a grandes rasgos como funciona la búsqueda de caminos internamente.</description>

Recientemente colgaron en su blog dos nuevas melodías, las que sonarían durante al finalizar con éxito un nivel o al morir en el intento. A continuación podréis escucharlas.
 Victoria: una canción alegre que se reproducirá en conjunción con la animación de celebración del protagonista. Se compone de dos partes: la primera es más intensa mientras que la segunda es más relajada y se reproduce en un bucle.</description>

      <description>¡Estamos muy contentos de presentar la demo técnica de Sion Tower!
Esta versión se ha liberado bajo la GPL 3 (código) y Creative Commons 3.0 (multimedia). Hablo en plural porque ya no trabajo en solitario en este proyecto, como ya sabéis Antonio Jiménez Rodríguez (arte 3D), Antonio Caro Oca (BSO) y Daniel Pellicer García (BSO) están colaborando activamente. Más que una primera versión, es una demo técnica a modo de escaparate de los avances hasta el momento, es decir, lo que se mostró en el último vídeo.</description>

      <description>En el blog de desarrollo no todo iban a ser alegrías y objetivos cumplidos, también es justo y necesario tratar los escollos del camino. La guerra de formatos y los insufribles dolores de cabeza que provocan aquellos que son privativos no es algo que nos pille de primeras. ¿Cuántas veces un escalofrío nos ha recorrido el cuerpo cuando una institución pública nos envía un formulario importante en .docx? De la misma manera, este problema nos lo encontramos en el mundo de la animación en tres dimensiones.</description>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/games/un-nuevo-enemigo-el-diablillo/</guid>
      <description>El colaborador Antonio Jiménez Rodríguez (AJR) continua trabajando con intensidad en el modelado, texturizado y animación de los personajes de Sion Tower. La prueba es este nuevo enemigo, el Diablillo.
AJR partió de la descripción del enemigo en el documento de diseño (GDD):
 Criatura del averno de estatura ligeramente superior al Goblin. Cuenta con la cola y los cuernos clásicos de los demonios. No lleva ropa y su rojo oscuro de piel le confiere un aspecto más despiadado.</description>

      <description>Gource es una herramienta para la visualización de la evolución de un proyecto a partir del log de su sistema de control de versiones. Gource es mucho más visual que StatSVN ya que utiliza OpenGL para renderizar de forma atractiva el árbol de ficheros del proyecto junto a sus atareados desarrolladores (como abejas en un panal). Es compatible con Git, Mercurial y SVN. Si quieren ver el nivel de actividad del proyecto y dejarme en ridículo, presionen al botón de reproducción.</description>

      <description>StatSVN es una herramienta que recopila información de un repositorio Subversion y genera un informe en HTML describiendo su desarrollo. Como veremos, es posible obtener una gran cantidad de datos relevantes que desvelan los hábitos de los miembros de un equipo y en qué medida ha contribuido cada uno. ¿Quieres conocer cómo se ha trabajado en el proyecto estos meses?
En el informe sólo se refleja mi actividad ya que los artistas que están colaborando con el proyecto no están dados de alta en la forja.</description>

      <description>Cuando me propuse buscar colaboradores para el proyecto no me esperaba tener una acogida tan buena. Hace unas semanas, Antonio Caro Oca (@Hempfreud) contactó conmigo vía Twitter ofreciéndose junto a Daniel Pellicer García (@Danpelgar) para componer la música de algún juego que desarrollase. Mis ojos se abrieron como platos rápidamente, ¡música expresamente compuesta para Sion Tower! Hoy os muestro los primeros resultados.
Antonio Caro y Daniel Pellicer solían componer y editar piezas para juegos imaginarios y se han mostrado muy entusiasmados por ver reflejado su trabajo en un producto tangible.</description>

      <description>En esta ocasión muestro una prueba de lo que será el primer nivel de Sion Tower así como una implementación del control de la cámara. Los objetos que componen la escena los he modelado y texturizado con Blender. Posteriormente, compongo el nivel también con Blender, lo exporto a formato DotScene de forma que el sistema de niveles se encarga de procesarlo y construir la escena.
La demo técnica que publicaré en unos días ofrecerá este escenario con un control de cámara más pulido y al protagonista definitivo creado por AJR (animaciones internas incluidas).</description>

La descripción del enemigo en el documento de diseño de Sion Tower es lo que ha tomado AJR para el bocetado y posterior modelado. Esto demuestra la importancia del GDD para transmitir los conceptos del juego a todos los miembros del equipo.</description>

      <description>Como pudisteis ver en el anterior vídeo ya he conseguido cargar un escenario creado con Blender. En este artículo pretendo explicar porqué he escogido Blender como editor de escenarios y cómo funciona el sistema de carga y gestión de niveles. Como veremos, aún me quedan puntos por implementar pero no quería abarcarlo todo desde el principio. Todo a su tiempo, al menos el diseño está pensado para ser escalable.
Blender vs Ogitor A comienzos de enero escribí un artículo en el que hablaba sobre un editor de escenarios desarrollado con QT y Ogre llamado Ogitor.</description>

Antonio Jiménez colaborará modelando, texturizando y animando los personajes, una aportación de lo más impresionante. Hará un encomiable esfuerzo compatibilizando sus compromisos profesionales con la colaboración en un proyecto de Software Libre como es Sion Tower. Por el momento nos muestra al protagonista del juego en varias poses demostrando su talento.</description>

      <description>Como ya he comentado, hace unas semanas me hice con un HTC Desire HD y desde entonces he estado matando las esperas de autobús con un buen puñado de juegos. En esta ocasión vengo a hablaros de Pro Evolution Soccer 2011 para Android. Durante los últimos años he preferido FIFA a PES aunque decidí darle una oportunidad, total, en un móvil no busco simulación sino una partida rápida.
Jugabilidad directa Es muy de agradecer poder arrancar el juego y comenzar un partido a los pocos segundos ya que no suelo dedicarle más de diez minutos de una sentada a ningún título móvil.</description>

      <description>Este nuevo vídeo muestra la carga de un escenario básico creado en Blender a partir de su exportación a formato DotScene. El sistema es capaz de cargar tanto objetos colisionables como fuentes de luz. En los próximos días profundizaré en la carga de escenarios. Así mismo, puede observarse el uso de la nueva versión de STC (sistema de colisiones de Sion Tower) lo que impide que el personaje atraviese objetos.</description>

      <description>Tras unas semanas de duro trabajo acabo de liberar la versión 0.2 de STC, el sistema de detección de colisiones de Sion Tower. Mientras implementaba la carga de niveles con elementos colisionables (de la que hablaré otro día) he probado más a fondo la primera versión descubriendo muchos puntos en los que la mejora era necesaria.
Muchas líneas del blog han versado sobre este tema. Si aún no conoces las funcionalidades de STC puedes leer el lanzamiento de su primera versión.</description>

Es una tontería no aprovechar dicho espacio ya que Red Iris cuenta con un indexado en buscadores excelente. Simplemente he colgado un panel explicando en qué consiste mi proyecto junto con enlaces a otros medios (wiki, blog, forja y Twitter).
No es nada del otro mundo ya que mis habilidades de diseño tienden a cero pero creo que será suficiente para ampliar un poco más la difusión del proyecto.</description>

No obstante, en mi cine habitual suelen retirar de cartelera el buen material con sorprendente rapidez dejando la carroña típica. Eso y el hecho de tener que elegir la intersección de los gustos entre los miembros del grupo hizo que acabásemos yendo a Más allá de la vida, dirigida por el veterano Clint Eastwood y nominada por los mejores efectos visuales.</description>

Al igual que la pequeña biblioteca de colisiones que he implementado, es muy reutilizable y sería una pena que el código no le sirva a nadie más. Por ello, he decidido liberar la versión 0.1 como paquete descargable desde la forja de Red Iris.

Tras contactar con el administrador hemos llegado a un acuerdo de colaboración de forma que contaremos con el respaldo de Creagamers más allá de este artículo inicial.

Uno de mis próximos objetivos para IberOgre era mejorar su difusión y parece que vamos viento en popa.</description>

 Colisiones I: Introducción, requisitos y alternativas Colisiones II: Diseño general de STC Colisiones III: La clase Shape y Collision Dispatching ColisionesIV: Tests de colisión  Mientras diseñaba e implementaba el sistema de detección de colisiones de Sion Tower (STC) he leído bastante y aprendido mucho al respecto. Es un tema muy complejo, crítico y delicado estudiado con detalle en varias ocasiones. Me queda muchísimo por aprender al respecto pero por razones de calendario no puedo permitirme abarcarlo todo antes de ponerme a trabajar.</description>

      <description>El siguiente objetivo en el desarrollo de Sion Tower era la implementación de un sistema de detección de colisiones. Hablamos de un apartado crítico en el desarrollo de un videojuego por la cantidad de cálculos que implica, hay que tener especial cuidado en ese sentido. Llevo un par de semanas trabajando en él de forma intensiva y al menos puedo decir que he conseguido algo que funciona. Les presento la versión 0.</description>

      <description>Cuando hace más de un año compré mi HTC Magic sólo había tres teléfonos Android en el mercado y todos del mismo fabricante. Alucinaba en colores con su conectividad, prestaciones y pantalla. ¡Tenía un teléfono más potente que mi primer ordenador! Como cualquier otro cacharro no tardó en quedarse anticuado y actualmente se resiente al trabajar casi con cualquier aplicación. Por ello he decidido renovarme y adquirir el HTC Desire HD, una auténtica bestia parda.</description>

      <description>Muchos seguidores de IberOgre estabais esperando un artículo a modo de introducción para aprender a inicializar el motor. Un artículo de lo más básico era imprescindible y estaba planificado desde el principio. No obstante, debido a diversos motivos no me ha sido posible publicarlo hasta ahora. El retraso ha sido imperdonable pero al menos me queda la satisfacción de haber cumplido el objetivo más prioritario de la lista de objetivos que publiqué hace unos días.</description>

      <description>Revenge of the Titans es un tower defense desarrollado por la compañía independiente Puppy Games. Me hice con él gracias al Humble Indie Bundle, ese magnífico pack de cinco pequeñas grandes obras al precio que el comprador estimase oportuno. No todos los días lanzan juegos multiplataforma sin DRM y durante las últimas semanas lo he estado disfrutando en mi querida Ubuntu. Sigan leyendo porque el &amp;ldquo;jueguecito&amp;rdquo; tiene una propuesta de lo más interesante.</description>

      <description>Había algunas películas decentes en la cartelera y gracias a unos cartuchos vacíos de impresora las entradas nos iban a salir gratis por lo que la situación no pintaba nada mal. Camino a la libertad de Peter Wier fue la opción escogida y es que el director de El club de los poetas muertos y de El show de Truman daba bastante confianza. A continuación leerán (o cerrarán la pestaña del navegador) una pequeña reseña firmada por un pésimo crítico de cine.</description>

      <description>Hace mes y medio comencé a utilizar el sistema de gestión de tareas de Red Iris para organizarme. Es mucho mejor marcarse tareas realizables en poco tiempo que trabajar con un plan a largo plazo. Por supuesto, estos objetivos deben estar encaminados hacia el plan global pero he comprobado que en proyectos pequeños se es más productivo con tareas concretas. Recientemente he ido cubriendo los objetivos cumplidos en forma de artículos publicados o sistemas desarrollados.</description>

      <description>Estos días he estado viendo varias películas que tenía pendientes, quizás por la falta de series durante las vacaciones. Es curioso como uno se acostumbra a visionados de episodios cortos, luego es más complicado sentarse a ver algo durante más de dos horas. Scott Pilgrim contra el mundo ha sido uno de los largometrajes que más repercusión han tenido en la red el pasado año junto a Inception o The social network y no me extraña teniendo en cuenta su temática.</description>

      <description>Alguna ventaja tenía que tener desarrollar un proyecto de cierto tamaño compuesto de dos partes (IberOgre y Sion Tower). Cuando estoy atascado en uno le doy un impulso al otro y eso es precisamente lo que me ha pasado los últimos días con el sistema de colisiones de Sion Tower. Tras horas de lectura, aprendizaje y frustración decidí aparcar el asunto y dedicarme a la wiki, la cual estaba algo solitaria.</description>

      <description>Una de las películas que más revuelo ha generado tanto en la red como en el Mundo Real™ ha sido, sin lugar dudas The social network. Como siempre, llego un poco tarde a la fiesta pero al menos he conseguido publicar la reseña antes de los Oscar. Pocas veces una película produce opiniones tan extremas. He oído de todo, desde que era completamente soporífera hasta que se trata del largometraje de la década, menuda barbaridad.</description>

      <description>Para poder trabajar en una wiki sobre el engine de renderizado Ogre3D he tenido que aprender a utilizar la biblioteca en algún sitio. Estos conocimientos también son indispensables para el desarrollo de Sion Tower. Lo cierto es que debería poner un disclaimer como una casa advirtiendo mi escasa experiencia porque aún estoy aprendiendo. En cualquier caso, en este artículo enumero las fuentes que he utilizado acompañadas de las razones por las que me han sido útiles.</description>

      <description>Como es lógico, los niveles de Sion Tower se almacenarán en ficheros y deberán contener información para poder desplegar el escenario, oleadas de enemigos, música etc. Escribir a mano un un fichero tan complejo es peor que una tortura propia de mafiosos. Por tanto, lo ideal sería disponer de un editor libre y multiplataforma con el que crear los niveles. El sistema de Sion Tower tomará la responsabilidad parsear los ficheros del editor y cargar los niveles.</description>

      <description>¿Otro comentario de un juego de hace año y medio? Caballeros, qué quieren que les diga, me tomo las cosas con calma. Mientras la masa se deja los cuartos en el Call of Duty de turno yo estaba a dos bandas entre Fifa 11 con su delicioso vestíbulo online 2vs2 y Batman Arkham Asylum. Rocksteady le ha dado una patada en la boca a todos aquellos que decían que los juegos de superhéroes no podían ser buenos.</description>

      <description>Siempre me han gustado las historias de investigación y acción en las que lo importante no es si el personaje descubre el misterio, sino cómo lo consigue. Creo que la nueva serie británica Sherlock entra dentro de la categoría. Se estrenó en UK el pasado verano con una crítica excelente. Aunque sus episodios constasen de 90 minutos de metraje, esta primera temporada sólo cuenta con 3 de ellos por lo que en unos días ya la había finiquitado.</description>

      <description>Como todo buen hijo de vecino, Sion Tower necesitará reproducir efectos de sonido y música de fondo, de otro modo al jugador se le caerían dos lagrimones y lo cerraría para siempre. Ogre es un motor de renderizado y no incorpora elementos como un subsistema de audio, por tanto, debía buscarlo en otro lugar. Como he comentado anteriormente, Ogre cuenta con un sistema de gestión de recursos muy potente y ampliable.</description>

      <description>Últimamente me he aventurado a comenzar series como The Walking Dead, Community o la que nos ocupa en estos momentos, Boardwalk Empire. He de reconocer que la apertura de miras ha venido bien pues no me he sentido demasiado decepcionado en ningún caso. ¿Quién sabe? Puede que sea un conformista. Como varias de las series de la HBO, estamos ante una obra de monóculo. La mano de Martin Scorsese se nota aunque sólo se haya visto involucrado de pleno en el episodio piloto.</description>

      <description>En la mayoría de videojuegos en tercera persona, la dirección hacia la que se mueve el personaje depende de la orientación de la cámara. A pesar de que Sion Tower es un tower defense, controlamos a un personaje en tercera persona y, por tanto, debía incorporar este sistema. Estos días he estado exprimiendo los sesos para implementar dicho movimiento. ¡Por fin! Tras decenas de diagramas con vectores, ángulos y sistemas de coordenadas, lo he conseguido.</description>

Como no podía ser de otra forma, el proyecto IberOgre y Sion Tower estará presente tanto como para buscar colaboradores como para ofrecer mano de obra barata (básicamente gratis).
Pero… ¿qué narices es un hackathon? Pues es una especie de maratón de desarrollo en el que los participantes presentan sus proyectos junto con una lista de pequeñas tareas pendientes.</description>

      <description>Los zombies están de moda, recibimos constantemente películas como Zombieland, El amanecer de los muertos o 28 días después. La fiebre de infectados ha invadido los videojuegos con Left 4 Dead, Plants versus Zombies o Dead Rising entre muchos otros. Las producciones impactantes, gores y casposas están a la orden del día y el mundo de las series no podía ser menos. La primera temporada de la adaptación del cómic con el mismo nombre ha llegado a su fin y aquí les ofrezco mis humildes impresiones.</description>

      <description>El puente se acaba y , entre otras cosas, me ha permitido darle un pequeño pero importante impulso a IberOgre. Ligeras correcciones o ampliaciones en varios artículos y un par completamente nuevos. La wiki va sobre ruedas y no hemos tenido problemas de disponibilidad desde el cambio de servidor, ¡gracias de nuevo a la OSLUCA! Lo que sigue es un pequeño resumen del trabajo de los últimos días.

      <description>Gestionar de forma eficiente el tiempo que le dedico al proyecto es complicado. Tras una dura mañana de trabajo, redactar un artículo para IberOgre o programar un módulo de Sion Tower se vuelve una carrera cuesta arriba. Aún así no me ha ido del todo mal hasta el momento, pues la wiki tiene varios artículos publicados y el GDD del videojuego está avanzado. En cualquier caso, espero no ser el único que tenga estos problemas.</description>

      <description>Como sabéis, GRUB (GRand Unified Bootloader) es un fantástico software que nos permite elegir entre los sistemas operativos que tengamos instalados en el momento del arranque. Para muchos es la salvación en una transición de Windows a GNU/Linux mientras que para otros es la forma de acudir suplicando a otro Kernel cuando el principal da problemas. El único problema que puede tener es que es un bastante feo. Al rescate de los vanidosos y acude BURG (Brand-new Universal loadeR from GRUB), nótese la ironía infinita al darle la vuelta a &amp;ldquo;GRUB&amp;rdquo;.</description>

Hace algunas semanas os hablaba del Game Design Document (GDD) en general y desde entonces he estado redactando el mío. Ha sido un paso duro (no disfruto con el papeleo) pero necesario para aclararme las ideas.
El documento se divide en varias secciones diferenciadas:</description>

      <description>Dentro de cada equipo que desarrolla un título AAA siempre sobresale la cabeza del &amp;ldquo;diseñador estrella&amp;rdquo;. Suelen ser personajes carismáticos y polémicos cuyas declaraciones nos bombardean cerca de la fecha de lanzamiento. Señores como Kojima (Metal Gear Solid), Molyneux (Fable), Mikami (Resident Evil) o Yamauchi (Gran Turismo) entre otros muchos. Reyes del hype y de la venta del humo, de eso no cabe duda pero, ¿imprescindibles genios dentro de los estudios de desarrollo?</description>

      <description>Es probable que hayáis notado caídas intermitentes del servidor durante las últimas semanas. IberOgre se aloja en el servidor de la Oficina de Software Libre de la Universidad de Cádiz (OSLUCA) que, amablemente, nos cedió un hueco. Fijaos si su bondad no conoce límites que concedieron espacio a muchas otras wikis para distintos proyectos. La cantidad de peticiones ha hecho que el sistema se sobrecargue y recientemente han comenzado las migraciones.</description>

      <description>Así es, yo tampoco me lo creía cuando lo vi pero el hecho es que el creador de Ogre, nuestro amado motor de renderizado, recomendaba IberOgre a través de la red de microblogging. Por supuesto, agradecerle infinitamente su interés con este pequeño pero importantísimo gesto que proporciona al proyecto más difusión. Sigan leyendo y les contaré los detalles.

Para poder continuar con el artículo &amp;ldquo;Creación básica de escenas&amp;rdquo; tenía que cubrir primero la gestión de recursos en Ogre y eso es exactamente lo que he hecho. Ya está publicado un nuevo artículo: &amp;ldquo;Gestión de recursos&amp;rdquo;.</description>

      <description>David Garrick fue un reconocido actor inglés del siglo XVIII. Estaba tan extraordinariamente dotado para la comedia, que los médicos recomendaban sus actuaciones como una especie de remedio mágico, capaz de sanar cualquier pena del alma. Podríamos decir que Garrick, sin saberlo, fue el primer risoterapeuta de la historia.
 Anoche acudí al espectáculo Garrick de Tricicle que tuvo lugar en el Gran Teatro Falla de Cádiz. Lo que para el mundo exterior supuso hora y media, a mí me parecieron solamente 30 breves minutos.</description>

      <description>Granny&amp;rsquo;s Bloodbath fue el proyecto que desarrollamos tres compañeros para la asignatura Diseño de Videojuegos en la Universidad de Cádiz durante el segundo cuatrimestre del curso 2009-2010. Se trata de un juego open source de plataformas y acción de scroll horizontal en el que manejamos a una abuelita que trata de sobrevivir a una invasión zombie. Armada con su bastón y la escopeta de su difunto marido avanzaba por tres niveles con sus correspondientes escenas narrativas y el obligado final boss.</description>

El taller: &amp;ldquo;Introducción al desarrollo de videojuegos con un Pong&amp;rdquo; va viento en popa y se celebrará los días 22 y 25 de noviembre de 17:00 a 20:00 en la Escuela Superior de Ingeniería de Cádiz. Lo impartimos principalmente Alberto Cejas y yo aunque contaremos con el apoyo de varios compañeros más.</description>

      <description>Los ojos de Julia se ha enfrentado a las obligadas comparaciones con el anterior largometraje de terror protagonizada por Belén Rueda, El orfanato. Ya saben, aquello de &amp;ldquo;la anterior era mucho mejor…&amp;quot;. Bah, pamplinas y lo dice alguien a quien le gustó mucho El orfanato. Hacía tiempo que todos los presentes de la sala se estremecían al unísono. Incluso algunos graciosos trataban de paliar su estrés soltando alguna ridícula burla en todo un alarde de testosterona.</description>

      <description>Llevo bastante tiempo utilizando Spotify en Linux a través de Wine y últimamente me estaba dando más disgustos que alegrías por problemas relacionados con el sonido. Raudo y veloz acudí a su alternativa más evidente, Grooveshark. En este artículo comentaré mi experiencia con ambos servicios de música por streaming de forma que puedan decidirse por alguno de los dos en caso de duda.

      <description>Cuando entré en la carrera se estaba constituyendo la Asociación de Desarrollo de Videojuegos de la Universidad de Cádiz (ADVUCA). Como os podéis imaginar, era un tema que me interesaba muchísimo y asistí emocionado al taller que organizaron sobre desarrollo en Nintendo DS con PAlibs. Este fue uno de mis primeros pasos en la programación de juegos. Desgraciadamente, la asociación nunca llegó a formalizarse y quedó en el olvido. ¡Este año unos compañeros nos hemos animado para alcanzar el resurgir de la ADVUCA!</description>

      <description>En Sion Tower no quiero perder demasiado tiempo con papeleo pero necesito llevar cierta organización dada la mediana envergadura del proyecto, conozco el valor de la Ingeniería del Software. Debo definir cuantos detalles pueda y conseguir que las mecánicas estén enfocadas a los objetivos que deseo y no otros, que pocas cosas se coloquen por casualidad. Además, si pretendo contactar con artistas en busca de colaboraciones no puedo ir con las manos vacías, hay que mostrar al menos un documento o prototipo que demuestre lo que se necesita y que el asunto es serio.</description>

      <description>Aunque lo terminé hacer un par de días, el decimotercer capítulo de la franquicia que más expectación genera se lanzó hace 8 meses. Ante las duras críticas que recibió, esperé a que alguna tienda online decidiese deshacerse desesperadamente del stock rebajándolo de forma considerable. Después de tanto tiempo es lógico que un artículo de estas características carezca de interés. No obstante, a lo largo de las líneas que siguen, ofrezco mi humilde opinión, libre de las ataduras de medios más politizados.</description>

      <description>Mientras continúo con los artículos de IberOgre he querido comenzar el desarrollo del videojuego que ejemplificará todo su contenido, Sion Tower. El trabajo de este fin de semana lo he invertido en hacer pruebas de concepto para aclarar las ideas y tantear el modelado con Blender. Próximamente redactaré un documento de diseño más formal entrando en un mayor nivel de detalle. A continuación, aparte de demostrar que el diseño no es lo mío (¿algún artista se ofrece a colaborar?</description>

      <description>No hay duda de que la democratización en la producción y distribución de contenidos a través de la red ha permitido proliferación de blogs, podcasts, wikis, etc. Ahora bien, que alguien pueda producir contenido es muy distinto a que lo haga bien. Diferenciar la calidad de lo mediocre en la inmensidad de Internet puede ser complicado y no todos tenemos tiempo para indagar. Todos aquellos que invierten su tiempo en producir un podcast merecen respeto, no obstante, hay que reconocer que algunos no cuentan con la calidad de audio, regularidad o nivel de preparación que nos gustaría.</description>

      <description>Durante las últimas semanas hemos asistido al anual y entrañable debate mediático que protagonizan el FIFA y el Pro Evolution Soccer de turno. Los medios de mayor tamaño ya han dado su veredicto gracias a sus fantabulosas copias promocionales pero eso no quiere decir que yo no pueda hablar de lo que me venga en gana aquí, en mi pequeño cuchitril. La pregunta es, ¿merece la pena dejarse los billetes en una nueva entrega?</description>

      <description>No me gusta informarme en exceso sobre las películas que voy a ver, la mayoría de los trailers revientan casi la totalidad del metraje y prefiero que las buenas obras me pillen por sorpresa, desarmado y sin ideas preconcebidas. Por eso salí de Buried en una especie de shock mientras comentaba mis impresiones a medio forjar con mis amigos y es que la película no es para menos.

XLand, Balloon Breakers y, por supuesto, IberOgre. Incluso espero que aún se presenten algunos más. En esta ocasión voy a hablar de Balloon Breakers, del compañero Jesús González Rodríguez, por utilizar Ogre3D como motor de renderizado y porque el autobombo local nunca está de más.</description>

      <description>Mi motivación con respecto al proyecto ha ganado enteros durante los últimos días ya que, en contra de todas mis previsiones a medio plazo, ya hay gente interesada en IberOgre. No sólo como lectores sino como colaboradores activos lo cual considero realmente importante. Jamás hubiera pensado que IberOgre pudiese atraer participantes en una fase tan temprana de su desarrollo (pocos se suben a un barco que no está casi terminado).</description>

      <description>Antes de decidirme a utilizar Ogre frente a otros motores de renderizado (Irrlicht) o incluso motores de juego completos (Panda 3D) estuve mirando lo que ofrecía cada uno. Es complicado guiarse por foros y comunidades ya que cada uno barre para casa, a veces con un ferviente fanatismo, ya os podéis imaginar. Ni de lejos soy un experto en desarrollo de videojuegos 3D y puede que haya pasado detalles por alto pero lo que más me llamó la atención de Ogre fue su capacidad de adaptación a todo tipo de situaciones.</description>

      <description>Demasiado tiempo he dilatado el visionado de Battlestar Galactica pero estamos ante una de las series por las que es imperativo tener verdadera predisposición o de lo contrario no exprimiremos su contenido como es debido. Una miniserie de dos episodios y 4 intensas temporadas forman la que es, a mi juicio, la mejor producción televisiva de ciencia ficción de todos los tiempos. Bueno, puede que aún esté en shock tras los capítulos finales pero os hacéis una idea.</description>

En las líneas que siguen, una breve opinión sobre esta serie de creciente éxito de la NBC.
Community nos lleva a la completamente lamentable Universidad de Greendale en la que convergen personajes de lo más variopinto.</description>

Cambiar constantemente de ventana puede ser un suplicio por lo que muchos optan por utilizar dos pantallas conectadas a su equipo. Menos usual pero igualmente posible es tener que manejar dos ordenadores al mismo tiempo, por ejemplo, el equipo de trabajo y el de pruebas. En tal caso tu mesa puede convertirse en un verdadero caos con tanto teclado y ratón estorbando, la solución es Synergy.</description>

A pesar de que Sion Tower sea un videojuego, el proyecto se encuentra bajo la categoría &amp;ldquo;Educación&amp;rdquo; por estar dirigido al aprendizaje de desarrollo de videojuegos en 3D con Ogre. En la fecha de redacción de este artículo no hay muchos proyectos registrado aunque seguro que la lista crecerá hasta alcanzar un buen número.</description>

Un libro extenso que, lejos de ser una obra maestra, te conduce en un fantástico viaje por la Inglaterra del S.XII y los inicios de la arquitectura gótica en Europa utilizando el desarrollo de sus personajes como medio de transporte. Desconocía que se estaba rodando una miniserie basada en la novela y me he lanzado a verla durante los últimos días, a continuación unas breves impresiones.</description>

      <description>Las mejores películas son las que provocan que el espectador se implique, se interese y se identifique con los personajes. Es muy complicado, por no decir imposible, generar cierta tensión en una escena si te importa un bledo lo que le ocurra al protagonista. Una pena que hubieran retirado de cartelera Los Mercenarios ya que tuve que asistir a la proyección de Centurión, un perfecto ejemplo de fracaso en llegar al público.</description>

En esta ocasión me dispongo a hacer lo propio con la correspondiente versión futurista, en la que las lanzas se sustituyen por bolters pesados y los carros de combate por Deadnoughts. Mi experiencia con Warhammer 40.0000 se reduce a poseer un regimiento de Marines Espaciales, aunque he tenido la ocasión de probar buena parte de los títulos que se listan a continuación.</description>

      <description>Uno de los mayores problemas de Android es la segmentación de versiones que sufre. No es raro ver usuarios con la 1.5 Cupcake instalada mientras que los más afortunados se encuentran en la 2.0 Froyo. Como seguramente sepas, esto se debe a numerosos factores como el retraso que imponen las operadoras o capas de interfaz que han de ser actualizadas aunque esto da contenido para otro artículo. Hace más de un año me hice con una HTC Magic a través de Vodafone y, desgraciadamente, aún estoy abandonado en la 1.</description>

      <description>En un post anterior hablé sobre cómo me introduje en la programación en Python con PyGTK y Glade desarrollando Tiny Backup. Antes que eso ya había experimentado un acercamiento al lenguaje de la serpiente en un ejercicio no extremadamente útil aunque curioso, el resultado fue Twigraph.
Twigraph Twigraph es un pequeño script que utiliza un wrapper de la API de Twitter y una biblioteca para trabajar con el lenguaje Dot de Graphviz.</description>

      <description>He estado trabajando en artículos para IberOgre desde su comienzo pero, tristemente, no se mostraba nada en la página principal. Esto producía una sensación de inactividad y dejadez que debía solucionar cuanto antes y, tras unos retoques, ya es posible ver los primeros resultados.
Debía utilizar plantillas para estructurar la página principal y otros elementos, además era necesario categorizar los artículos existentes. Mi desconocimiento sobre la edición en wikis supone un gran problema a tal efecto.</description>

      <description>Tras haber visto a Leonardo DiCaprio en un largometraje notable como ha sido Inception (aunque su actuación no fuera excepcional) decidí darle una oportunidad Shutter Island, una película que había dejado pasar durante su proyección en salas. Excepto su protagonista los involucrados son totalmente distintos, dirigida por Martin Scorsese y escrita por Laeta kalogridis aunque la novela original es de Dennis Lehane. No obstante, tal y como fui advertido resulta tremendamente similar a Origen y no solo por el actor principal.</description>

      <description>Hace un par de semanas blogs especializados como El Androide Libre publicaban rumores sobre una posible asociación entre Google y Sony para crear un terminal Android dedicado al gaming. Sé que llego tarde, como de costumbre, pero me pareció una oportunidad interesante para mostrar mi opinión al respecto. Evidentemente aún no ha sido confirmado nada y en este artículo no puedo sino dejar llevar mi imaginación por un mundo ficticio de color rosa.</description>

      <description>El principal problema de Dante&amp;rsquo;s Inferno fue su fecha de lanzamiento, febrero de este año, demasiado cercano a la super-producción God of War III o al polémico Bayonetta. Desconozco si fue una decisión comercial de EA o producto algún retraso en Visceral Games, lo cierto es que el hecho no le hizo ningún favor de cara a la crítica especializada ni a las ventas. Con tanto hack&amp;quot;n slash entre las manos el tiro les salió por la culata.</description>

      <description>Escucho podcasts desde hace bastante por lo que necesito un sistema de suscripción que pueda utilizar para descargar los últimos episodios automáticamente y sincronizarlos con mi iPod de manera sencilla. Por supuesto, los problemas se acaban para los usuarios de Windows y Mac utilizando iTunes (mientras que puedan soportarlo), no obstante los usuarios de GNU/Linux lo tienen más complicado. En mi Ubuntu probé varias alternativas como GtkPod, Rythmbox e incluso Amarok aunque ninguna me convenció.</description>

      <description>Inception es el largometraje que puede consagrar a Christopher Nolan como guionista y director de culto. Tras obras como &amp;ldquo;The Prestige&amp;rdquo;, &amp;ldquo;Memento&amp;rdquo; o &amp;ldquo;The Dark Knight&amp;rdquo; nos trae un viaje de ciencia ficción muy complicado de describir. Poco o nada sabía de esta película hasta que se produjo el sensacionalista despliegue mediático de los últimos días. Apariciones en televisión, tercer puesto en IMDB (los rankings siempre son polémicos) e incluso la he visto retratada como &amp;ldquo;la mejor película de todos los tiempos&amp;rdquo; en algún blog.</description>

      <description>Según Amanita Design su último título, Machinarium, sólo había sido adquirido de forma lícita por entre el 5% y el 15% de los que lo habían jugado. En lugar de ponerse a llorar por los rincones han decidido declarar la &amp;ldquo;amnistía&amp;rdquo; a los piratas dándoles una segunda oportunidad y dejando el juego a 5 dólares, es decir, algo menos de 4€. La crítica alabó a este producto indie tras su lanzamiento en octubre de 2009 así que, ni corto ni perezoso, lo compré y he estado jugándolo durante los últimos días.</description>

      <description>Si quieres conocer una biblioteca o un lenguaje nuevos lo mejor es, sin lugar a dudas, utilizarlos. Había mirado ya algunas cosas sobre Python pero hace algunos meses sentí la necesidad de programar algo pequeño para adquirir un mínimo de destreza. Había oído maravillas de lo sencillo y elegante que era diseñar la interfaz de una aplicación de escritorio con Glade y manejarla con PyGTK desde Python. Por tanto me puse manos a la obra y desarrollé Tiny Backup en un par de días.</description>

      <description>El término &amp;ldquo;juego educativo&amp;rdquo; está lleno de connotaciones negativas, parece que necesariamente ha de ser un tostón impresionante jugarlo. Hace cierto tiempo me recomendaron escuchar una serie de conferencias pertenecientes al I Congreso Internacional de Videojuegos en la Universidad Complutense de Madrid publicadas en el feed de Arsgames. En uno de los archivos sonoros encontré una exposición de Juancho Carrillo, Project Manager en Tonika Games (pequeño estudio español), sobre juegos educativos.</description>

      <description>Hoy no voy a hablar del último videojuego del mercado, de hecho Dead Space fue lanzado en octubre del 2008. No tengo la necesidad de otros medios por hablar de las últimas novedades así que voy a mi ritmo. Pongámonos en situación, Dead Space fue desarrollado por Visceral Games (que nombre más bello) y distribuido por EA en varias plataformas: Playstation 3, X-Box 360 y PC. Venía con una promesa de lo más interesante, adaptar el género del Survival Horror a los tiempos que corren donde reinan de manera apabullante los shooters en primera persona.</description>

      <description>Estos días he estado tratando de establecer un entorno de trabajo multiplataforma para trabajar en los ejemplos de IberOgre y en el propio Sion Tower. Lo ideal, para mí, era poder compilar con herramientas libres y sin tener que depender de ningún IDE. Al no ser la forma habitual de desarrollar de la comunidad de Ogre, la documentación era escasa y acertar ha sido sorprendentemente complicado. Les contaré mi periplo:</description>

      <title>Guía de estilo para C&#43;&#43; de Google</title>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/computing/guia-de-estilo-para-c-de-google/</guid>
      <description>Cuando se programa es de suma importancia que el estilo sea uniforme, máxime, si trabajamos en un equipo de varias personas. Por si no supusiera suficiente esfuerzo comprender código ajeno aunque éste cuente con comentarios, hacerlo cuando cada desarrollador sigue su propio criterio puede ser una pesadilla. Es ahí donde entran en juego las guías de estilo. Hay muchas y ninguna tiene por qué ser mejor que otra a priori, no obstante, es recomendable ceñirse a una.</description>

      <description>Mientras trabajamos en Granny&amp;rsquo;s Bloodbath se nos ocurrió la idea de hacer un port a PSP del juego. Fui el encargado de la tarea y, cuando me puse manos la obra, descubrí que la documentación era pobre y en la mayoría de casos errónea. Lo cierto es que fue toda una aventura descubrir cómo crear un juego para PSP en C++ usando SDL y otras librerías sin cambiar el código original.</description>

      <description>A la hora de desarrollar software es muy importante diseñar correctamente la interfaz, no importa si es una web o una aplicación de escritorio. Antes de lanzarnos a programar como posesos, durante el análisis y el diseño es altamente recomendable realizar bocetos o esquemas de las pantallas con las que contará la aplicación así como la forma de interactuar con las mismas. Para ello nos podemos ayudar de alguna herramienta para crear bocetos de interfaces de usuario (mockups o sketching).</description>

      <description>Green Zone es una película que, para mí, pasó desapercibida durante su proyección en salas pero finalmente me he decidido a verla. Basada en la novela &amp;ldquo;Vida imperial en la ciudad Esmeralda&amp;rdquo; con un guión escrito por Brian Helgeland y dirigida por Paul Greengrass. ¿Qué me ha impulsado a verla? Una tarde por delante y pocas ganas de digerir una película compleja. Finalmente es lo que, en cierto modo, he obtenido.</description>

      <description>Usar en todas las webs y servicios en los que tengamos una cuenta la misma contraseña es altamente peligroso. Lo ideal sería utilizar contraseñas largas, que combinasen caracteres alfanuméricos con diversos símbolos. Entonces es cuando surge el dilema, ¿cómo me voy a acordar de todo?
La necesidad de utilizar un gestor de contraseñas se hace evidente y KeePassX cumple bien su función. Se trata de un software en el que podemos almacenar todas nuestras contraseñas de manera segura, protegidas por una clave maestra y un fichero encriptado.</description>

      <description>&amp;ldquo;La sombra del águila&amp;rdquo;, una novela bélica escrita por Arturo Pérez-Reverte en 1993. Hacía, quizás, demasiado tiempo que no leía un libro y esta breve narración me ha venido de maravilla para recuperar el gusanillo.
1812, Napoleón y sus consejeros vigilan la batalla de Sbodonovo desde una colina durante la invasión a Rusia. Su flanco derecho estaba siendo arrasado cuando, a través del catalejo se divisa al batallón 326 de infantería.</description>

      <description>Como he comentado en el artículo de presentación de mi PFC, parte del mismo será una documentación sobre la programación de videojuegos en 3D utilizando Ogre como motor gráfico. Inicialmente iba a publicar dicha documentación en formato PDF con una licencia libre pero he decidido crear una wiki. De esta forma será posible darle mucha más difusión y, en el mejor de los casos, crear una comunidad de programadores de videojuegos en 3D a su alrededor.</description>

      <description>Hasta ahora en los trabajos en los que he participado y que han requerido un sistema de control de versiones se ha utilizado Subversion. Funciona de maravilla en grupos pequeños y cuenta con una curva de aprendizaje más que razonable. Cuando la elección del sistema de control de versiones para mi proyecto parecía estar clara ha surgido la idea de utilizar Git en su lugar.
Muchos compañeros en la Universidad me han hablado de sus virtudes y he seguido su consejo.</description>

Estoy seguro de que será muy difícil respetarla de manera estricta pero al menos quiero intentarlo, por ello me he dado unos plazos bastante razonables (hay que ser realista).
Seguiré el consejo de mi tutor de proyecto e iré registrando el progreso real, de manera que, comparando la planificación estipulada con el trabajo realizado, me daré cuenta en qué partes me he equivocado y se han producido más inexactitudes.</description>

Documentación de Ogre3D Básicamente la decisión ha sido crear un manual de referencia en español sobre los conceptos básicos de la programación en 3D y el motor Ogre3D.</description>
