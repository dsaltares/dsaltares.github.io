      <description>By Sarah Kilian on Unsplash  To err is human, and I certainly have made my share of mistakes in my career as an engineering leader. Undoubtedly, I still have quite a few yet to make. Like with software incidents, it is vital to reflect and learn from mistakes, so that our system becomes more robust and we grow as professionals.
Today, I thought it would be interesting to go through 6 mistakes I have made as an engineering leader.</description>

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To err is human, and I certainly have made my share of mistakes in my career as an engineering leader. Undoubtedly, I still have quite a few yet to make. Like with software incidents, it is vital to &lt;a href=&#34;./a-template-for-great-incident-reviews&#34;&gt;reflect and learn from mistakes&lt;/a&gt;, so that our system becomes more robust and we grow as professionals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today, I thought it would be interesting to go through 6 mistakes I have made as an engineering leader.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1-skipping-1-1s&#34;&gt;1. Skipping 1-1s&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Skipping 1-1s was never really a habit for me. I’ve always made it a priority to be available for my team. However, I’ve had reports who didn’t take enough ownership over their 1-1s. When that time of the week came, I would sometimes get a chat message:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hey, I don’t have anything for 1-1 today. Shall we skip it?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We were super busy, so agreeing was highly tempting. In doing so, I was missing out on the opportunity to:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Share my expectations and feedback around 1-1 ownership.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Empower and motivate the individual.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Set goals and maintain accountability.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Later, I learned to ask &lt;a href=&#34;https://lauratacho.com/blog/how-can-i-make-my-1-1s-less-boring&#34;&gt;better questions&lt;/a&gt;, put the individuals in the driver&amp;rsquo;s seat, and make the most of 1-1s.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2-underestimating-having-a-clear-technology-strategy&#34;&gt;2. Underestimating having a clear technology strategy&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many managers dictate and involve themselves in every technical decision their teams make. I want to empower my teams to make their own decisions and genuinely have agency over the software they build, ship and maintain. However, for multiple squads to do that consistently, you need a couple of things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Excellent communication across teams/squads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A clear technology vision and strategy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It took me too long to support my teams by sharing a clear technology vision and strategy that would become the principles on which they could base technical decisions. Once I did that, it felt like magic. We were all rowing our technology in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It doesn’t need to be too comprehensive. Just be clear about the kinds of tradeoffs you want the team to make. I will dive deeper into this one at some point with a separate article.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3-not-setting-clear-expectations&#34;&gt;3. Not setting clear expectations&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There have been instances where an individual was surprised when receiving feedback from me. That is usually a robust signal that expectations were not clear enough. As long as expectations are clear, folks have enough self-awareness to reflect and identify a problem after receiving feedback about something not working out great.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Making the expectations of each role in your organization public is a fantastic tool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help everyone understand what is expected of them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Increase equity, people in the same role are not evaluated against different standards.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater understading of what it takes to progress.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When shared externally, it can be a great recruiting tool.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you should complement this with &lt;a href=&#34;https://themanagershandbook.com/coaching-and-feedback/running-one-on-ones&#34;&gt;great 1-1 sessions&lt;/a&gt;, good cross-team understanding of roles and responsibilities, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4-not-hiring-engineering-managers-first&#34;&gt;4. Not hiring Engineering Managers first&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back in January 2021, I found myself in the position to increase capacity fast. To do that, I had to &lt;a href=&#34;./how-to-hire-8-engineers-in-8-weeks&#34;&gt;grow the Aula engineering team from 7 to 25 in record time&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yikes!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I knew hiring Engineers was hard, but finding fantastic Engineering Managers (EMs) is much worse. In Europe, managers also tend to have longer notice periods, up to 3 months!. The pressure to increase capacity was so high that I mistakenly prioritized individual contributor (IC) roles over the manager ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a consequence, my team grew well beyond my management capacity. If I remember correctly, I had 15 reports at one point. I still had to do all these Engineering Manager interviews, so the quality of my feedback went down, and it became increasingly hard to help the team push in the same direction.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What would have happened if I had focused on increasing managerial capacity first? Maybe short-term velocity would not have gone up, but I would have achieved a few things:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Much higher hiring capacity with lower pressure on ICs.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Significant improvements to feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Greater alignment across product squads.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5-not-investing-enough-in-team-building&#34;&gt;5. Not investing enough in team building&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In a rapidly growing organization, folks start working closely with other people they do not know at all. Even though everyone works hard, software delivery does not progress as expected.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is no trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not because you hired the wrong people, but simply because you have made no room for individuals to build trust with each other. Thanks to the feedback I received, we invested much more in getting to know each other and building that trust. The team gelled and worked much more effectively together after that.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Thanks for reading. Hopefully, some of these have provided you with some insight.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>By Camilo Jimenez on Unsplash  Incident response can be stressful. The system is on fire, the team has to fix it ASAP, and you&amp;rsquo;re working against the clock. Your users are getting frustrated, the company loses money, stakeholders constantly check for updates, and trust is at risk. What a nightmare!
The tension is so high that the incident responder forgets to communicate effectively or is so worried about keeping folks up to date that they take the wrong action, further compromising the system.</description>

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Incident response can be stressful. The system is on fire, the team has to fix it ASAP, and you&amp;rsquo;re working against the clock. Your users are getting frustrated, the company loses money, stakeholders constantly check for updates, and trust is at risk. What a nightmare!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tension is so high that the incident responder forgets to communicate effectively or is so worried about keeping folks up to date that they take the wrong action, further compromising the system.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your team may greatly benefit from an incident playbook at times like this. When a new incident kicks off, the responder creates a new document from a template. This document serves as a guide on how to respond to the incident. It removes a lot of stress from the situation and helps the team resolve the problem faster.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://plot.co&#34;&gt;Plot&lt;/a&gt;, we have a Notion template for our incidents that looks something like this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;checklist&#34;&gt;✅ Checklist&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The responder ticks off actions as they go through them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;begin-task-list&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Assign yourself and acknowledge the alert or the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Start populating the log below.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Start communications:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;begin-task-list&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Post a message in the &lt;code&gt;#downtime&lt;/code&gt; Slack channel about the active outage.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Start a call to better coordinate and send the link to the &lt;code&gt;#engineering&lt;/code&gt; Slack channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Update status page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Work on the issue:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;begin-task-list&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; If you need help from a team member with domain expertise, page them.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; First, stabilize the system.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Then, resolve the issue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When the issue is resolved:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;span class=&#34;begin-task-list&#34;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Update status page.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Update the &lt;code&gt;#downtime&lt;/code&gt; channel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Write an incident review doc and share it in &lt;code&gt;#downtime&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;input disabled=&#34;&#34; type=&#34;checkbox&#34;&gt; Schedule an incident review call with the engineering team.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-log&#34;&gt;✍️ Log&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Populating the following log during the incident helps the responder put together an &lt;a href=&#34;./a-template-for-great-incident-reviews&#34;&gt;incident review document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;table&gt;
&lt;thead&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Finding or action taken&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Details&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;th&gt;Timestamp&lt;/th&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/thead&gt;
&lt;tbody&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;Alert triggered&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;link&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;td&gt;March 11, 2022 10:17&lt;/td&gt;
&lt;/tr&gt;
&lt;/tbody&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-additional-tips-for-the-incident-responder&#34;&gt;🚀 Additional tips for the incident responder&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤝 You are not alone in this. Ask for help if you need it and delegate.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🗣 High severity incidents: consider making some other team member the owner of communications so that you can focus on the other steps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🔐 Security incidents: choose appropriate wording for public communications to avoid the vulnerability from being exploited further.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚠️ If you stop being available during an incident, put a continuity plan is in place.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you can adapt this template to your needs. The main idea is that having a checklist in the first place avoids stress when responding to a problem.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Thanks for reading! I would love to hear from you if you have any thoughts around checklists for incident response.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>By Sieuwert Otterloo on Unsplash  Software incidents suck big time. Suddenly, you have more work to do; the sprint is derailed; stakeholders raise their eyebrows and start asking questions. Nobody wants that! Unfortunately, incidents do happen. Complex software systems are bound to fail from time to time.
An incident can also be an opportunity. Your job is to make sure to seize it. Incident review docs followed by a discussion help a lot.</description>

  &lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Software incidents suck big time. Suddenly, you have more work to do; the sprint is derailed; stakeholders raise their eyebrows and start asking questions. Nobody wants that! Unfortunately, incidents do happen. Complex software systems are bound to fail from time to time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An incident can also be an opportunity. Your job is to make sure to seize it. &lt;strong&gt;Incident review docs&lt;/strong&gt; followed by a discussion help a lot. Above all else, the main goal of incident reviews is to &lt;strong&gt;learn&lt;/strong&gt;, although great incident reviews can achieve much more.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify ways to make the system more robust.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Identify and close process gaps.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Learn about the system they maintain and develop.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Protect the trust with the rest of the company and customers by being transparent.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understand user impact better and develop user empathy.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Help future team members understand the systems&amp;rsquo; weak points and how incidents are handled.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recommend the following approach, which &lt;a href=&#34;./6-tips-to-make-remote-meetings-more-inclusive/&#34;&gt;makes the process more inclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incident leader/responder writes the review doc.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The team reads and comments async.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everyone gets together to reflect and align on actions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here&amp;rsquo;s an incident review doc template that has worked well in my teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-authors&#34;&gt;✍️ Authors&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List the people who put the incident review document together. It will help future readers know who to ask for more information.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-summary&#34;&gt;🗞️ Summary&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Write out the TLDR version of what happened.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-impact&#34;&gt;🔥 Impact&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When talking about impact, you should consider several dimensions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🚶‍♂️ &lt;strong&gt;User&lt;/strong&gt;: were users unable to carry out a particular action? Was their data lost? Was their data compromised? How did that affect their lives or jobs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👩‍💼 &lt;strong&gt;Business&lt;/strong&gt;: a helpful way to think about this one is to try to answer the question, how much money did the company lose with this incident?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;⚽ &lt;strong&gt;Team&lt;/strong&gt;: did someone wake up in the middle of the night to respond? Did people work late? Was the sprint interrupted because many team members had to work on remediation?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-detection&#34;&gt;🚨 Detection&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did the team become aware of the issue? At best, an alert told you something was wrong even before users became aware. At worst, a user had to submit a ticket to Product Support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-triage&#34;&gt;🔍 Triage&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What were the actions taken by the responder to assess the severity of the issue and escalate?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-root-causes&#34;&gt;🐛 Root causes&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share the team&amp;rsquo;s steps to investigate the issue and identify the root cause. Include information gathered from observability tools like screenshots or links to dashboards. Do not spare details here. Everyone can learn a lot about how the system works from this section.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am a firm believer in &lt;a href=&#34;https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/&#34;&gt;blameless postmortems&lt;/a&gt;, although I am conscious of how easy it is to avoid attribution. Focus on the circumstances that triggered the incident instead of the individuals. But be careful not to skip the root cause entirely.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-resolution&#34;&gt;🧯 Resolution&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What actions did the team take to bring the system back to normal? How did you make sure everything was, indeed, okay?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Again, don&amp;rsquo;t forget the charts!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-timeline&#34;&gt;⏱️ Timeline&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Share the complete list of events. Compiling the actual timeline is much easier when the incident leader takes notes during the incident.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Timestamp.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Action or discovery.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-lessons-learned&#34;&gt;👩‍🎓 Lessons learned&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Knowing what happened, it&amp;rsquo;s time to reflect. I like to focus on three categories.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👍 What went well&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👎 What went wrong&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🤞 Where we got lucky&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about it in terms of software and processes and avoid attributing individual blame.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-actions-and-issues&#34;&gt;⏭️ Actions and issues&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;List of remediation and preemptive actions. Ideally, all of them have a corresponding ticket. Focus on process improvements and technical work to address what went wrong and avoid depending on luck. As an engineering leader, it&amp;rsquo;s your job to work with Product Management and prioritize those tickets.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-share-it&#34;&gt;👐 Share it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Always share the document with the entire organization. In some cases, consider sharing an adapted version with customers. It may feel scary and shameful. However, being open about mistakes and your actions to improve is a great way to protect the trust you worked so hard to build.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Thanks for reading. Hopefully, this template can help you make the most of the situation when your system blows up. I would love to hear from you if you&amp;rsquo;re approaching things differently.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Help Engineers understand the Why</title>

      <description>Every engineer in the team must understand the why.
Can everyone confidently answer the question:
 What problem are we trying to solve with this user story?
 Understanding the why is essential to the success of a project and the team&amp;rsquo;s performance. A group of people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand users or their problems cannot build a high-quality product.
Sure, you have well-specified epics and user stories. Still, during delivery, the team will have to make dozens of decisions that are not detailed in the ticket.</description>

  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/understand-the-why.webp&#34; alt=&#34;team building a wooden house&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Every engineer in the team must understand the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Can everyone confidently answer the question:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What problem are we trying to solve with this user story?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Understanding the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt; is essential to the success of a project and the team&amp;rsquo;s performance. A group of people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand users or their problems cannot build a high-quality product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sure, you have well-specified epics and user stories. Still, during delivery, the team will have to make dozens of decisions that are not detailed in the ticket. There are two options. Either delivery grinds to a halt, with engineers constantly asking the Designer/PM. Or they make the decisions themselves. To make the right decisions, everyone needs to understand users, the problem, and the solution.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everyone needs to understand the &lt;em&gt;why&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many organizations struggle with this. Engineers focus on closing the next ticket in time for sprint review, and PMs are frustrated when features suffer delays because they were subpar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an engineering leader, the bad news is that you are responsible for the situation. The good news is that you can turn the ship around.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-dog-food-the-product&#34;&gt;🐶 Dog-food the product&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What easier way to understand the product better than to use it every day?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well&amp;hellip; None.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Admittedly, some organizations have it easier than others. Engineers at &lt;a href=&#34;https://honeycomb.io/&#34;&gt;Honeycomb&lt;/a&gt; use their own product to observe Honeycomb. If your product doesn&amp;rsquo;t lend itself naturally to be used by engineers, there are still things you can do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.plot.co/&#34;&gt;Plot&lt;/a&gt;, we build a tool to help you create learning experiences like the world&amp;rsquo;s best learning designer. We&amp;rsquo;re running a challenge where we will all design a course using our tool. Not only will everyone familiarize themselves with the experience of using the product, but we will also collect loads of valuable feedback.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-engineers-join-ux-interviews&#34;&gt;🧪 Engineers join UX interviews&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Engineers who talk to users are bound to get to know them better. They can read written feedback, but there&amp;rsquo;s nothing like talking to them face to face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You can suggest they join your team&amp;rsquo;s Designer on the next series of user interviews that validate the solution they will work on next. Start with Engineers shadowing, so they become comfortable. Perhaps you&amp;rsquo;ll get a few individuals interested in conducting interviews themselves!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-the-team-refines-together&#34;&gt;👌 The team refines together&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many teams do not refine user stories together. I am shocked at the number of instances when just the Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and Designer discuss the backlog. The Engineering Manager breaks down stories into tasks and assigns them to individuals in the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I cannot state how extremely damaging that is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, Engineers only receive a piece of the puzzle, making it impossible to see the bigger picture. Secondly, they never get the chance to break stories into smaller chunks, missing out on developing a crucial skill.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Refining together is a great way to share knowledge about the system, where the pitfalls and the opportunities are.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-design-sprints--ideation-sessions&#34;&gt;👨‍🎨 Design sprints &amp;amp; ideation sessions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having Engineers and other roles participate in design sprints or ideation sessions before a solution is presented to them is fantastic. Instead of thinking about the solution at hand, everyone is now thinking about the actual problem or frictions users face.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are a couple of bonuses. One is that Engineers feel more ownership over what they build. The other one is that Engineers might identify great solutions a Designer or PM thought to be technically infeasible. Yet another classic example of why diverse teams build better products.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-everyone-does-support&#34;&gt;💬 Everyone does support!&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&amp;rsquo;s typical of early-stage startups for everyone to help out with the help desk rotation. The Product Support team may not even exist yet! However, this normally stops the second the Support team assembles.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A day where the Product Development team helps with Product Support will be a true eye-opener. There is nothing like seeing raw user frustration first-hand. It puts the roadmap into perspective.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-make-product-part-of-the-jd-and-interview-process&#34;&gt;👩‍💻 Make Product part of the JD and interview process&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If your interview process focuses exclusively on technical knowledge, you may attract Engineers who are not interested in understanding users.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about the questions and conversations you may have to understand better how candidates think about user problems and solutions.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-make-time-for-it&#34;&gt;⏳ Make time for it&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you cannot just add new responsibilities to your team and expect nothing else to change. It&amp;rsquo;s an investment. The team may move slightly more slowly initially to increase quality and velocity later.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Do you have other practices or techniques? Please do let me know!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a heated tech job market. The most heated tech job market in history!
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it will last. I know that it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be an engineer right now. Yet, many people seem to forget a job interview goes both ways. Too many great developers make it through the interview process, asking superficial questions. Reality slaps them in the face when they start in their new role.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/interview-laptop.png&#34; alt=&#34;laptop with code on screen&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a heated tech job market. &lt;a href=&#34;https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-for-tech-workers-to-navigate-a-heated-job-market/&#34;&gt;The most heated tech job market in history&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it will last. I know that &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/13/analyzing-the-software-engineer-shortage/?sh=8c36ed0321c6&#34;&gt;it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be an engineer&lt;/a&gt; right now. Yet, many people seem to forget a job interview goes both ways. Too many great developers make it through the interview process, asking superficial questions. Reality slaps them in the face when they start in their new role.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Awful team dynamics, managers excluding valuable team members, ego contests, lack of feedback, no proper coaching, etc. The list goes on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Has this ever happened to you? Read on!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recognize that not everyone can afford to be picky when looking for a job. It is a privilege. You may even fear coming across as fussy or difficult to work with. However, good interviewers should see real and profound questions as positive. You show that you have clear values and a vision for the kind of organization you want to be a part of. As an experienced interviewer, I promise that you will be better off.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;What questions should you be asking though?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, you may want to learn all about the technology stack and their agile practices. Get those questions out of the way ASAP. Ideally, the team should have those &lt;a href=&#34;https://dev.to/aulaeducation/aula-behind-the-scenes-of-the-learning-experience-platform-our-stack-1gno&#34;&gt;publicly documented somewhere&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s go over eight questions you can ask your potential engineering manager. They will help you answer whether you want to work there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1--what-are-the-expectations-of-the-role-what-would-you-expect-from-me-in-30-days-and-in-3-months&#34;&gt;1. 🏆 What are the expectations of the role? What would you expect from me in 30 days? And in 3 months?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some managers do not set clear expectations. Awful! Their reports are often surprised during performance reviews. If they can share an actual expectations doc, that would be perfect.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Actual expectations shape culture. That is what the people you may work with will optimize for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Asking about different timeframes will help you understand the onboarding experience and timeframes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2--what-is-the-teams-biggest-challenge&#34;&gt;2. 🏔️ What is the team&amp;rsquo;s biggest challenge?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Does the answer feel like an exciting problem for you to solve? Or is it more like a glimpse into a world of chaos that makes you want to run away and never look back?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3--how-are-technical-decisions-made&#34;&gt;3. 🤔 How are technical decisions made?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are technical decisions exclusively made by a little boys club no one can join? I have been on the receiving end of that, and it is frustrating as hell. You want to look for a team where individuals of all levels make proposals.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments&#34;&gt;RFC&lt;/a&gt;/&lt;a href=&#34;https://adr.github.io/&#34;&gt;ADR&lt;/a&gt; format works well. This is because &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/12/10/the-art-of-asynchronous-optimizing-efficiency-in-remote-teams/?sh=42bfa18a747c&#34;&gt;async communication acts as a leveler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4--how-are-product-decisions-made-what-role-do-engineers-play&#34;&gt;4. 🧪 How are product decisions made? What role do engineers play?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are engineers treated like code monkeys, key pushers, or mere resources? In too many places, it&amp;rsquo;s the Engineering Manager, the only one who talks to the Product Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Are you passionate about the products you build? Then you want to make sure engineers join ideation sessions and even user interviews.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5--what-does-career-progression-look-like&#34;&gt;5. 🧗‍♀️ What does career progression look like?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When you talk about expectations, it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to ask about career progression. Are great engineers forced into management as the only option available?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As long as they document expectations, you should be able to check out those for the level above the one you applied for.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6--how-do-you-run-your-1-1s-what-is-your-coaching-style&#34;&gt;6. 🤝 How do you run your 1-1s? What is your coaching style?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many managers run them as status updates with little to no structure. Instead, 1-1 time should be &lt;a href=&#34;https://themanagershandbook.com/coaching-and-feedback/running-one-on-ones&#34;&gt;structured and belong to you&lt;/a&gt;. They are a place for you to give and receive feedback, build a trusting relationship, and discuss growth.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7--whats-your-strategy-to-break-down-silos-and-avoid-a-small-bus-factor&#34;&gt;7. 🚌 What&amp;rsquo;s your strategy to break down silos and avoid a small bus factor?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Teams where people work in their little corner, will hamper your development. They also tend to descend into chaos when the person who does X is on holiday or ill. Presumably, you want to be part of a team where sharing knowledge is rewarded.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The team may work in cross-functional groups, pair, organize tech talks or run guilds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8--think-of-the-last-couple-of-engineers-who-left-what-were-their-reasons&#34;&gt;8. 🚪 Think of the last couple of engineers who left. What were their reasons?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The reasons may be complex as people usually are. Now is the moment to try and sense whether you are about to step into a drama fest. Most people who leave because it was the natural step in their career do so in friendly ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Want more?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I recently wrote &lt;a href=&#34;./the-david-test-an-updated-joel-test-for-2022/&#34;&gt;The David test&lt;/a&gt;, a list of questions to evaluate engineering teams. You may also find inspiration there.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Did you ever ask a question that provides you with lots of insight about the company you were about to join? Please do share!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>How I got into Engineering management</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/how-i-got-into-engineering-management/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 21 Feb 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://saltares.com/how-i-got-into-engineering-management/</guid>
      <description>Recently, people, who are considering becoming Engineering Managers, have asked about my own experience.
How did I get into it? How did I know it was what I wanted to do?
The answer may be interesting to others, so I wrote it down.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to note that becoming a manager is not a promotion. It&amp;rsquo;s a career change. There&amp;rsquo;s a myriad of reasons not to be a manager.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/management/girl-fork-road.png&#34; alt=&#34;A girl faces a fork in the road&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Recently, people, who are considering becoming Engineering Managers, have asked about my own experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How did I get into it?
How did I know it was what I wanted to do?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The answer may be interesting to others, so I wrote it down.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to note that &lt;a href=&#34;https://themanagershandbook.com/introduction#it-and-x27-s-not-a-promotion-it-and-x27-s-a-career-change&#34;&gt;becoming a manager is not a promotion&lt;/a&gt;. It&amp;rsquo;s a career change. There&amp;rsquo;s a myriad of &lt;a href=&#34;https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/&#34;&gt;reasons not to be a manager&lt;/a&gt;. Being a great individual contributor (IC) does not mean you will be a great manager. And, leadership does not equal management.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, my personal experience may not be similar to that of others. As a white, young, straight man, I have enjoyed loads of privilege throughout my career. Even as an immigrant. People often paid attention to what I had to say and, until recently, I didn&amp;rsquo;t even notice. My career is the result of hard work, (earned) luck, and privilege.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s get into it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-did-before-becoming-a-manager&#34;&gt;What I did before becoming a manager&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/management/crytek.png&#34; alt=&#34;crytek uk reception&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My full-time career started at &lt;strong&gt;Crytek UK&lt;/strong&gt;, a video games studio, where I spent a couple of years. In the beginning, I was a Junior Developer. Later I was a mid-level one. I spent most of that time at the intersection between character AI and animation. I made the baddies and civilians look natural. The job required me to collaborate with many disciplines. It was quite the list: designers, animators, producers, and gameplay/AI/animation programmers. Later, I took on the role of Scrum Master. That role helped me focus on outcomes over my contributions. This also gave me some stakeholder management skills!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/management/sony.png&#34; alt=&#34;entrance to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe&amp;amp;rsquo;s offices in London&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Right after, I spent six months at &lt;strong&gt;Sony&lt;/strong&gt; as an R&amp;amp;D Software Engineer. There, I had to manage up to improve our engineering practices and introduce CI. That is also when I started having some difficult conversations related to feedback. Those would prove invaluable later on.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;
  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/management/bloomberg.png&#34; alt=&#34;Bloomberg London Office&amp;amp;rsquo;s central staircase&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Then, I joined &lt;strong&gt;Bloomberg&lt;/strong&gt;, where things kicked off big time. During the first two years, my role was Senior Software Engineer. After that, I took on the Team Lead role, Bloomberg&amp;rsquo;s title for Engineering Manager in other places. In total, I was there for five years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Here are some of the things I did before becoming a team lead.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🕸️ &lt;strong&gt;Owning projects with many dependencies&lt;/strong&gt;: ours was an applications team. That meant we depended on many infrastructure teams. Projects usually had a significant coordination overhead.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏈 &lt;strong&gt;Being a Scrum master&lt;/strong&gt;: similarly to what I was doing at Crytek.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;👩‍💻 &lt;strong&gt;Mentoring and coaching&lt;/strong&gt;: we regularly had interns or new hires joining the team. A few times, I would be their mentor/buddy. This involved running my first 1-1s, setting goals, and giving feedback.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🏫 &lt;strong&gt;Helping with the graduate training class&lt;/strong&gt;: Bloomberg ran several graduate cohorts a year. Each ran for 12 weeks. During the workshops, engineers helped the grads with their projects by talking through problems or doing code reviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;✅ &lt;strong&gt;Being an interviewer&lt;/strong&gt;: during my time there, I did hundreds of interviews and hired many engineers. I became more comfortable building rapport with new people and handling difficult situations. It made me think hard about the interview process and its faults. I wanted to be responsible for the process and improve it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;📚 &lt;strong&gt;Taking leadership training&lt;/strong&gt;: everyone had to take this course before becoming a manager.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;🦸‍♂️ &lt;strong&gt;Having a mentor&lt;/strong&gt;: right after I became a people manager, I started working with a mentor. It was invaluable to have someone I could talk to about specific situations and peer review decisions. It helped me to explore and establish my management style and principles.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many of these opportunities would not have come my way without a supporting manager. At some point, my manager moved to another team. I was offered the role, and I took it.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;was-i-sure-i-wanted-to-get-into-management&#34;&gt;Was I sure I wanted to get into management?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Hell no!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I loved the individual contributor (IC) role. Solving technical problems and building a product people enjoyed. Losing that was scary! In the end, two factors made me give it a try:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The incredible reward of amplifying the powers of the team. Helping people develop and breaking down some organizational silos felt terrific.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;I had seen people make the opposite transition, going from manager back to IC. It could be a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html&#34;&gt;two-way door decision&lt;/a&gt; after all.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&amp;rsquo;s no perfect answer, and you should come up with your own reasons for making the change. Arguably, one could go a long way being an amplifier of their team and helping people develop as an IC!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Thanks for reading. I hope it was useful!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>5 books you should read as a new Engineering Manager</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/5-books-you-should-read-as-a-new-engineering-manager/</link>

      <description>Stepping into the engineering manager role is challenging. The skills that got you there are not the skills that will make you succeed in your new role. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, you will feel lonely. The folks who were your peers are now your reports. Those relationships are entirely different now.
You will need plenty of support.
Having a mentor was certainly invaluable, and you should aim to have one.</description>

  &lt;img src=&#34;./img/books/library.webp&#34; alt=&#34;modern library&#34;&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Stepping into the engineering manager role is challenging. The skills that got you there are not the skills that will make you succeed in your new role. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, you will feel lonely. The folks who were your peers are now your reports. Those relationships are entirely different now.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You will need plenty of support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Having a mentor was certainly invaluable, and you should aim to have one. A few selected books gave me tremendously helpful insights. There is a lot of faff on the Internet out there about leadership. So, I thought writing a list may help you find the good ones!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-1-the-managers-handbookhttpsthemanagershandbookcom&#34;&gt;🙌 1. &lt;a href=&#34;https://themanagershandbook.com/&#34;&gt;The Manager&amp;rsquo;s Handbook&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Written by &lt;a href=&#34;https://alexmaccaw.com/&#34;&gt;Alex MacCaw&lt;/a&gt; as the actual handbook for managers at Clearbit. It covers a wide range of topics, such as self-awareness, hiring, coaching, expectation setting, and processes with down-to-earth, actionable advice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The book is quite opinionated, which may not be an entirely bad thing if what you need right now is a bit of structure before you find your management principles and style.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-2-leading-snowflakeshttpsleadingsnowflakescom&#34;&gt;❄️ 2. &lt;a href=&#34;https://leadingsnowflakes.com/&#34;&gt;Leading Snowflakes&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/orenellenbogen&#34;&gt;Oren Ellenbogen&lt;/a&gt; takes you through the transition from Maker to Manager in this short and to the point guide. Each chapter comes with a bit of &amp;ldquo;homework&amp;rdquo; to put what you learned into practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As a bonus, you should subscribe to Oren&amp;rsquo;s newsletter &lt;a href=&#34;https://softwareleadweekly.com/&#34;&gt;Software Lead Weekly&lt;/a&gt;. It is &lt;strong&gt;the&lt;/strong&gt; engineering manager newsletter.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-3-radical-candorhttpswwwradicalcandorcomthe-book&#34;&gt;🌟 3. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/&#34;&gt;Radical Candor&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As an Engineering Manager, you will need to have many challenging conversations. They can be a tremendous emotional drain. You need to let a team member know they are underperforming, but you don&amp;rsquo;t want to be an ass. I get it. Radical Candor by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/kimballscott&#34;&gt;Kim Scott&lt;/a&gt; can give you some of the tools to deliver difficult feedback with care and make it easier on your mental health.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-4-the-five-dysfunctions-of-a-teamhttpsenwikipediaorgwikithe_five_dysfunctions_of_a_team&#34;&gt;✋ 4. &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Five_Dysfunctions_of_a_Team&#34;&gt;The Five Dysfunctions of a Team&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A fable by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni&#34;&gt;Patrick Lencioni&lt;/a&gt; that tells the story of a newly appointed CEO who finds all sorts of politics and issues within her executive team. This book helped me realise that I no longer had one team, my engineering team. My teammates were now the engineering leadership group.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;-5-the-new-one-minute-managerhttpswwwkenblanchardcomstorethe-new-one-minute-manager&#34;&gt;🕑 5. &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.kenblanchard.com/Store/The-New-One-Minute-Manager&#34;&gt;The New One Minute Manager&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Another fable, this time by &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Blanchard&#34;&gt;Ken Blanchard&lt;/a&gt;. Perhaps this one is a bit dated, but I remember it dearly as it is one of the first ones I read. It tells the story of a new manager who seeks the knowledge of the legendary One Minute Manager.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Thanks for reading! Did you notice how only one of these is specific to engineering?&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>The David Test - An updated Joel Test for 2022</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/the-david-test-an-updated-joel-test-for-2022/</link>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/the-david-test-an-updated-joel-test-for-2022/</guid>
      <description>The famous Joel Test is a super quick and fun way to evaluate an engineering organisation by answering 12 simple &amp;ldquo;yes or no&amp;rdquo; questions. At the end, you get a score over 12. There is a problem however.
The test is now 22 years old 😱.
Tools and processes to build software have changed a fair bit over the last two decades. What was considered a potential nice to have, may have become an absolute basic.</description>
      <content>&lt;p&gt;The famous &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/&#34;&gt;Joel Test&lt;/a&gt; is a super quick and fun way to evaluate an engineering organisation by answering 12 simple &lt;em&gt;&amp;ldquo;yes or no&amp;rdquo;&lt;/em&gt; questions. At the end, you get a score over 12. There is a problem however.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The test is now 22 years old 😱.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tools and processes to build software have changed a fair bit over the last two decades. What was considered a potential nice to have, may have become an absolute basic. So, I decided to come up with my own, updated test. Make sure to read &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2000/08/09/the-joel-test-12-steps-to-better-code/&#34;&gt;the original one&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Behold the &lt;strong&gt;David Test&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can new joiners set up and run the system locally in less than one day by just reading the docs?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Are your builds made without any human intervention?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you automatically deploy to production?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is the system, to some degree, observable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a technical debt strategy you actually follow?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Is your team predictable?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the squad (Engineering + PM + Design) refine the backlog together?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do engineers have sizeable chunks of time free of meetings?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Can engineers choose the best tools for the job?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Does the team collectively own quality and have a testing strategy?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a standardized interview process?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Do you have a continuous discovery culture?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;rsquo;s dive a bit deeper.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;1--can-new-joiners-set-up-and-run-the-system-locally-in-less-than-one-day-by-just-reading-the-docs&#34;&gt;1. 👩‍💻 Can new joiners set up and run the system locally in less than one day by just reading the docs?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Companies that do not have a simple and well documented environment setup process suffer all sorts of issues.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When a new engineer joins, they spend forever before they can even think of contributing with a code change. As the process is not documented, they get blocked constantly. Multiple people need to help, as knowledge is spread across. As a result, the new joiner is frustrated from day 1!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A more insidious consequence is the myriad of subtle issues different members of the team experience over time as everyone has environments configured in significantly different ways.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ideally, a new engineer should follow the documentation and bring up the application locally within 30 minutes max.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;2--are-your-production-builds-made-without-any-human-intervention&#34;&gt;2. 🚚 Are your production builds made without any human intervention?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Many companies still rely on developers making production builds on their local machines to ship changes. Not only does this take time, it also introduces a silly amount of risk.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I once caused a major outage after some local changes made it into a build that got deployed 🙈. I am deeply embarrassed but it&amp;rsquo;s very much a real story and the best example I can give to illustrate this point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let machines make the builds in reproducible environments with no human intervention at all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;3--do-you-automatically-deploy-to-production&#34;&gt;3. 🚢 Do you automatically deploy to production?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When teams deploy to production after every merge to the &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt; branch something magical happens. The size of every deployment becomes smaller and the feedback loop tightens. The consequences are fantastic:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Changes are smaller, the risk of a change breaking the system is reduced.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a breaking change is introduced, it&amp;rsquo;s easier to identify it and fix it.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;The cost of integrating code becomes tiny.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, teams should routinely deploy to production multiple times a week. Ideally, there should be multiple deployments to production a day, one for every merge to &lt;code&gt;main&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The rule is &lt;a href=&#34;https://charity.wtf/2021/02/19/how-much-is-your-fear-costing-you/&#34;&gt;15 minutes or bust&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;4--is-the-system-to-some-degree-observable&#34;&gt;4. 🌡️ Is the system, to some degree, observable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Observability has many facets and folks often misunderstand what it means. Essentially, can you answer questions about the state of our system and what real users are experiencing just by looking at its outputs?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the very least, some of the following need to be present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Logging&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Monitoring&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Alerting&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Tracing&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Tracing is, perhaps, the most advanced, so you get a pass if you don&amp;rsquo;t have it!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;5--do-you-have-a-technical-debt-strategy-you-actually-follow&#34;&gt;5. 🏦 Do you have a technical debt strategy you actually follow?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too much technical debt can slow you down to a crawl. At the same time, &lt;a href=&#34;https://martinfowler.com/bliki/TechnicalDebtQuadrant.html&#34;&gt;no technical debt at all is also bad&lt;/a&gt;! Engineering orgs should have a strategy outlining their approach to technical debt and actually follow it. This often requires strong relationships of trust and alignment with other roles within Product such as Product Managers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Not having a strategy means that tech debt is tackled in a chaotic, unstructured way, thus limiting the impact. Perhaps, tech debt is not even tackled at all!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;6--is-your-team-predictable&#34;&gt;6. 📊 Is your team predictable?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hackernoon.com/why-estimating-is-so-damn-hard-d0f945f30185&#34;&gt;Estimates are damn hard&lt;/a&gt; but the reality is that businesses need to know approximately when projects will be done, contracts may depend on them! A team that seldom misses deadlines in a sustainable way is one that builds a tremendous amount of trust. It&amp;rsquo;s one of the key indicators of high performing teams.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;rsquo;t need to be able to predict everything with high precision. In order to be predictable, you must break down projects into tiny increments. These tiny increments are a lot easier to predict. If you continuously deploy your incomplete increments behind feature flags, the chances of having something releasable when time runs out are much higher.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;7--does-the-squad-engineering--pm--design-refine-the-backlog-together&#34;&gt;7. 👌 Does the squad (Engineering + PM + Design) refine the backlog together?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Too often does one see teams where it&amp;rsquo;s just the lead and the PM who refine the backlog. Then, the lead breaks stories into tasks and assigns them to the team. That is a horrendous practice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Not everyone will be aligned on what the team is making and why. People will make worse decisions during implementation, resulting in more back and forth or the wrong thing gets built.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;When a diverse set of people who feel safe to contribute refine together, you will inevitably &lt;a href=&#34;https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter&#34;&gt;build a better product&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Individuals will never learn how to break down a larger story into smaller chunks.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;People lose agency over the work they do and become disengaged.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;8--do-engineers-have-sizeable-chunks-of-time-free-of-meetings&#34;&gt;8. 🤔 Do engineers have sizeable chunks of time free of meetings?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remote work has become more mainstream and many folks no longer need to deal with noisy open plan offices. However, that does not mean they are free to do deep work for large chunks of time because their calendars may be full with a collection of Zoom calls spread across the day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Everybody is different, but most people are more productive when they can block out time for deep, uninterrupted work.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;9--can-engineers-choose-the-best-tools-for-the-job&#34;&gt;9. 🛠️ Can engineers choose the best tools for the job?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Being able to get the best tools money can buy is crucial. Engineers are expensive and you don&amp;rsquo;t want to pay them so that they can spend endless hours fighting their tools or doing work that could easily be automated by an off the shelf product.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We can take this forward and say that there isn&amp;rsquo;t a single toolbox to fit them all. People may feel more comfortable with a particular IDE and they should have the freedom to not have to rewire their brain in order to become proficient with another one.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;10--does-the-team-collectively-own-quality-and-have-a-testing-strategy&#34;&gt;10. 🐛 Does the team collectively own quality and have a testing strategy?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Traditionally, teams that cared about quality simply had a separate QA department. I think that dilutes the ownership of quality in product delivery teams. In my experience, quality is higher when the whole cross-functional squad cares about it and owns it. You may still have a QA role, but they should be embedded within the team.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It certainly helps when a testing strategy exists, it&amp;rsquo;s documented and actually applied. This document should outline the principles for automated and manual testing ans well as figuring out what to test.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;11--do-you-have-a-standardized-interview-process&#34;&gt;11. 💬 Do you have a standardized interview process?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The first step an organisation can take to avoid having a completely &lt;a href=&#34;https://betterprogramming.pub/the-software-engineering-hiring-process-is-broken-and-exclusionary-1632cc5a030c&#34;&gt;broken interview process&lt;/a&gt; is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://themanagershandbook.com/hiring-and-onboarding/hiring-101&#34;&gt;standardize it&lt;/a&gt;. An established process everyone goes through allows you to compare candidates more effectively while minimizing bias. It will become slightly easier to increase the diversity of the team, although it &lt;a href=&#34;https://lauratacho.medium.com/recruiting-more-underrepresented-candidates-wont-magically-make-your-organisation-inclusive-96651c6fb4b8&#34;&gt;won&amp;rsquo;t magically make your team more inclusive&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A standard process is the absolute bare minimum. Do you want to work at a place where only buddies are hired, everyone thinks the same and it&amp;rsquo;s basically a group of techbros?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;12--do-you-have-a-continuous-discovery-culture&#34;&gt;12. 🔍 Do you have a continuous discovery culture?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The iterative process does not only apply to actually delivering the software, it&amp;rsquo;s extremely relevant within discovery as well. Organisations that continuously learn about users, test for product market fit and analyse the usage of the most recently released feature will always have the upper hand. When folks other than the PM and designer are involved, the team is set up for success. Look at whether, as an engineer, you can actively participate in the following.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;User interviews.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Design sprints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A/B testing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;-what-is-your-organisations-score&#34;&gt;✅ What is your organisation&amp;rsquo;s score?&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;12/12 is ideal. 10/12 is ok, it&amp;rsquo;s always good to aspire to do better! Anything below it and you should start making some changes, NOW.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Thanks for reading!&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s already been a while but, back in November last year, I participated in a panel about remote work organised by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). It was fantastic to share thoughts and opinions with other folks that had different backgrounds and experiences.

      <guid>https://saltares.com/sticky-nav-bar-on-scroll-with-react-hooks/</guid>
      <description>Recently, I built a small React application that had a header, a navigation bar underneath and then the content. After scrolling past the header, the navigation bar was supposed to stay at the top and not scroll away.
Like so.
 Making the navigation bar position: fixed; top 0; was not going to cut it because the header had to come first unless we scrolled past the navigation bar.
I wanted to keep the component that controls the layout as simple as possible, so I abstracted the stickiness logic into a useSticky hook.</description>

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;&amp;gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;            &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#39;0px&amp;#39;&lt;/span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;        }}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      /&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &amp;lt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;main&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;className&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;content&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt; /&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &amp;lt;/&amp;gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  );
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;You stick (no pun intended) the &lt;code&gt;stickyRef&lt;/code&gt; into the thing that you want to fix to the top after you scroll past it. Then, &lt;code&gt;sticky&lt;/code&gt; will indicate whether it should be fixed at the top or not. I then use that to apply a &lt;code&gt;sticky&lt;/code&gt; class.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-css&#34; data-lang=&#34;css&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sticky&lt;/span&gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;position&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;fixed&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;top&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;}
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The extra &lt;code&gt;div&lt;/code&gt; below the &lt;code&gt;nav&lt;/code&gt; adds some extra padding so that the content does not immediately jump below the navigation bar when this becomes fixed at the top.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🌟 The magic happens in the &lt;code&gt;useSticky&lt;/code&gt; hook itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class=&#34;highlight&#34;&gt;&lt;pre tabindex=&#34;0&#34; style=&#34;color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;&#34;&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-js&#34; data-lang=&#34;js&#34;&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;import&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useEffect&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt; } &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;from&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;react&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useSticky&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; () =&amp;gt; {
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stickyRef&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useRef&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;null&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sticky&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setSticky&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;false&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;const&lt;/span&gt; [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setOffset&lt;/span&gt;] &lt;span style=&#34;color:#f92672&#34;&gt;=&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useState&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#ae81ff&#34;&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;);

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;      &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt;;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;

&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    };
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    window.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;addEventListener&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;scroll&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;handleScroll&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;    &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; () =&amp;gt; window.&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;removeEventListener&lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&#34;color:#e6db74&#34;&gt;&amp;#34;scroll&amp;#34;&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;handleScroll&lt;/span&gt;);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  }, [&lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;setSticky&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stickyRef&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;offset&lt;/span&gt;]);
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;  &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;return&lt;/span&gt; { &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;stickyRef&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;sticky&lt;/span&gt; };
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;};
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;display:flex;&#34;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;export&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#66d9ef&#34;&gt;default&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span style=&#34;color:#a6e22e&#34;&gt;useSticky&lt;/span&gt;;
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;The first effect measures the vertical offset of the element we want to fix at the top after it&amp;rsquo;s scrolled past. The second one listens to the &lt;code&gt;scroll&lt;/code&gt; event and determines whether we have scrolled past the element&amp;rsquo;s top edge and it needs to become sticky.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;🙌 Hope this is useful!&lt;/p&gt;
