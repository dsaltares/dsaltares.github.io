<p>Recently, people, who are considering becoming Engineering Managers, have asked about my own experience.</p>
<p>How did I get into it?
How did I know it was what I wanted to do?</p>
<p>The answer may be interesting to others, so I wrote it down.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s take a moment to note that <a class="text-contentLink text-lg" href="https://themanagershandbook.com/introduction#it-and-x27-s-not-a-promotion-it-and-x27-s-a-career-change">becoming a manager is not a promotion</a>. It&#x27;s a career change. There&#x27;s a myriad of <a class="text-contentLink text-lg" href="https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/">reasons not to be a manager</a>. Being a great individual contributor (IC) does not mean you will be a great manager. And, leadership does not equal management.</p>
<p>Additionally, my personal experience may not be similar to that of others. As a white, young, straight man, I have enjoyed loads of privilege throughout my career. Even as an immigrant. People often paid attention to what I had to say and, until recently, I didn&#x27;t even notice. My career is the result of hard work, (earned) luck, and privilege.</p>
<p>Let&#x27;s get into it.</p>
<h3>What I did before becoming a manager</h3>
<img class="mb-1" src="/img/management/crytek.webp" alt="crytek uk reception"/>
<p>My full-time career started at <strong>Crytek UK</strong>, a video games studio, where I spent a couple of years. In the beginning, I was a Junior Developer. Later I was a mid-level one. I spent most of that time at the intersection between character AI and animation. I made the baddies and civilians look natural. The job required me to collaborate with many disciplines. It was quite the list: designers, animators, producers, and gameplay/AI/animation programmers. Later, I took on the role of Scrum Master. That role helped me focus on outcomes over my contributions. This also gave me some stakeholder management skills!</p>
<img class="mb-1" src="/img/management/sony.webp" alt="entrance to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe&#x27;s offices in London"/>
<p>Right after, I spent six months at <strong>Sony</strong> as an R&amp;D Software Engineer. There, I had to manage up to improve our engineering practices and introduce CI. That is also when I started having some difficult conversations related to feedback. Those would prove invaluable later on.</p>
<img class="mb-1" src="/img/management/bloomberg.webp" alt="Bloomberg London Office&#x27;s central staircase"/>
<p>Then, I joined <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, where things kicked off big time. During the first two years, my role was Senior Software Engineer. After that, I took on the Team Lead role, Bloomberg&#x27;s title for Engineering Manager in other places. In total, I was there for five years.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I did before becoming a team lead.</p>
<ul>
<li>🕸️ <strong>Owning projects with many dependencies</strong>: ours was an applications team. That meant we depended on many infrastructure teams. Projects usually had a significant coordination overhead.</li>
<li>🏈 <strong>Being a Scrum master</strong>: similarly to what I was doing at Crytek.</li>
<li>👩‍💻 <strong>Mentoring and coaching</strong>: we regularly had interns or new hires joining the team. A few times, I would be their mentor/buddy. This involved running my first 1-1s, setting goals, and giving feedback.</li>
<li>🏫 <strong>Helping with the graduate training class</strong>: Bloomberg ran several graduate cohorts a year. Each ran for 12 weeks. During the workshops, engineers helped the grads with their projects by talking through problems or doing code reviews.</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Being an interviewer</strong>: during my time there, I did hundreds of interviews and hired many engineers. I became more comfortable building rapport with new people and handling difficult situations. It made me think hard about the interview process and its faults. I wanted to be responsible for the process and improve it.</li>
<li>📚 <strong>Taking leadership training</strong>: everyone had to take this course before becoming a manager.</li>
<li>🦸‍♂️ <strong>Having a mentor</strong>: right after I became a people manager, I started working with a mentor. It was invaluable to have someone I could talk to about specific situations and peer review decisions. It helped me to explore and establish my management style and principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these opportunities would not have come my way without a supporting manager. At some point, my manager moved to another team. I was offered the role, and I took it.</p>
<h3>Was I sure I wanted to get into management?</h3>
<p>Hell no!</p>
<p>I loved the individual contributor (IC) role. Solving technical problems and building a product people enjoyed. Losing that was scary! In the end, two factors made me give it a try:</p>
<ol>
<li>The incredible reward of amplifying the powers of the team. Helping people develop and breaking down some organizational silos felt terrific.</li>
<li>I had seen people make the opposite transition, going from manager back to IC. It could be a <a class="text-contentLink text-lg" href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html">two-way door decision</a> after all.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&#x27;s no perfect answer, and you should come up with your own reasons for making the change. Arguably, one could go a long way being an amplifier of their team and helping people develop as an IC!</p>
