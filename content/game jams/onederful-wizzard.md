Onederful Wizard is a puzzle action game where a little wizard goes
from room to room defeating monsters with a single fireball.

The theme of the game jam was "Only One", so we created a game where
you have only one shot to solve all the puzzles and defeat all the
enemies. After casting the spell, you will have to go a fetch it
again so you can keep going.
