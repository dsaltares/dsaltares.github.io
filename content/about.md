ðŸ‘‹ Hi! I am David Saltares, a VP Engineering with over 10 years of experience building products, both within big tech and startups.

I am passionate about technology and leading teams to create excellent products that people love. My belief is that trust-based, empowered, [inclusive](https://hbr.org/2016/11/why-diverse-teams-are-smarter), and autonomous teams are the key to high performance. My role is to amplify, unblock, coach, and support, so they can do what they do best. People, not resources, make products!

Over here, I talk mostly about [engineering leadership](/categories/leadership/), [software development](/categories/development/) and [hobbyist games development](/categories/games-development/).

You can find more about my experience on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davidsaltares/). If you're interested in my open source work, check [Github](https://github.com/dsaltares). And, if you want to chat, send me a [tweet](https://twitter.com/d_saltares).
