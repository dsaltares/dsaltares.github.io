✏️ [Doodle](https://github.com/dsaltares/doodle) is a crazy drawing & guessing chain game. Think Pictionary meets Telephone. Get on a video call with friends and give it a try. It's completely free and has no ads.

🦠 I made it a side project during covid-19 confinement to be played during covid-19 confinement.
