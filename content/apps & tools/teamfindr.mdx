âš½ [Team Findr](https://teamfindr.saltares.com) is a mobile-first app to help you find nearby pick up games, organise games with your friends and find extra players. It is completely free and has no ads.

ðŸ¦  I made it a side project during the winter holiday of 2020 as I had to self-isolate after direct contact with a covid-19 positive person. Later, my friend [Cristi](https://www.linkedin.com/in/cristian-iordan-26b1abb7/), did an entire UX pass and UI redesign.
