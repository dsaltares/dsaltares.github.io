Just a quick update this time. A while back I [mentioned](/games/book-learning-libgdx-game-development/) that I had been doing some technical reviewing on a LibGDX book, and now it's finally out.

[Learning LibGDX Game Development](http://www.packtpub.com/learning-libgdx-game-development/book) by Andreas Oehlke explains the basic features of the mighty framework whilst building a simple platformer from scratch. Even though it isn't an advanced read, it"ll surely help whoever doesn't have a huge deal of experience in games development and wants to give LibGDX a try. I really like that approach for novices, as it illustrates quite clearly how the jigsaw fits together.

Check it out on the Packt website to see whether or not you"re interested and stay tuned because they usually feature loads of bargains/bundles, specially during the weekends.
