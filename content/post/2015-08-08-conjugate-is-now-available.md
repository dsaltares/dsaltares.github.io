[Conjugate](https://github.com/dsaltares/conjugate) is a free, multi-language verb conjugator service and it is now available at [saltares.com/conjugate](https://saltares.com/conjugate).

It"dead easy: select the target language, enter the infinitive form, either in English or the target language, and press the _Conjugate_ button to get a nice list with all its conjugated forms. You don't know how to conjugate a verb whilst on the go? No worries, Conjugate's design is responsive, which means it looks neat on any device. Mobile devices were actually my primary target when coming up with the layout.

For now it only supports Spanish, Romanian and German although I will be adding more languages in the upcoming days.

Check out the quick GIF demo below, give the real thing a go and
[let me know what you think](https://github.com/dsaltares/conjugate/issues), feedback is really appreciated.
