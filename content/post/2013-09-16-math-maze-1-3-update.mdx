I'm pleased to say that [Math Maze 1.3 is finally out on Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.math). This release has quite some more juice than the other ones as it's the first to feature new content. Here's the complete list of changes.

- 5 new levels (total of 40) including the new % operator.
- Polish locale thanks to my friend [Konrad](http://konradkierys.com/).
- Bug fixes (first one I found post release!)

The module operator gives the remainder of the division and it's pretty cool because it allows me to add a new layer of complexity to level design. Expect things to get a bit more complicated in upcoming level packs!

Please, send your feedback my way through the mail button in the game, the blog, Google Play or any other way.
