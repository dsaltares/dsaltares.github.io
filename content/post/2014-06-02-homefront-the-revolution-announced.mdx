At last! The game I worked on during my 2 years at Crytek UK has been announced with an amazing trailer. Big congratulations at the Nottingham team for the huge effort put into this project. What a bunch of incredibly talented people, I'm really honoured to have been part of the project.

I mainly worked on emergent AI systems for NPCs and animation. Unfortunately, you cannot see much of that on this trailer. Let's wait and see for E3!
