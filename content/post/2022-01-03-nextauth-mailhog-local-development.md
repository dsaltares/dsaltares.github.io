[NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/) makes it shockingly easy to add authentication to [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) apps. It's free, open source, it lets you own your data and it supports a ton of identity providers, including [one time passwords](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/One-time_password) or "magic links".

Working with NextAuth.js is trivial, it sounds too good to be true!

Of course, there is a catch...

The developer experience worsens because you now need a network connection to log into your locally running app, even if your database is also local. Bye bye to chill sessions of working on the train.

You can fix that with a local SMTP server! Let's see how we can set it up. I will be showing code samples, but you can find a full working example of this post [here](https://github.com/dsaltares/saltares-blog-examples/tree/main/nextauth-mailhog).

### üîê Set up NextAuth.js with the `EmailProvider`

Let's assume you already have a Next.js application. If you don't have NextAuth.js configured, the first thing is to follow the tutorial on their landing page. Then, set the `EmailProvider` in `/pages/api/auth/[...nextauth].js`.

```ts
import NextAuth from 'next-auth';
import EmailProvider from 'next-auth/providers/email';

export default NextAuth({
  providers: [
    EmailProvider({
      server: {
        host: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_HOST,
        port: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PORT,
        auth: {
          user: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_USER,
          pass: process.env.EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD,
        },
      },
      from: 'NextAuth <noreply@example.com>',
    }),
  ]
});
```

For the `EmailProvider` to work, you also need to install the `nodemailer` package.

```bash
$ yarn add nodemailer
```

Remember that you also need to provide an [Adapter](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/overview) to NextAuth.js so that it can persist data. In [my example](https://github.com/dsaltares/saltares-blog-examples/blob/main/nextauth-mailhog/pages/api/auth/%5B...nextauth%5D.js#L9), I use the [`PrismaAdapter`](https://next-auth.js.org/adapters/prisma).

### üì¨ Set up your local SMTP server

We're going to use [MailHog](https://github.com/mailhog/MailHog), an open source email testing tool that comes with an SMTP server you can run locally. Conveniently, they have a zero config Docker image!

Create a `docker-compose.yaml` file or update your existing one and define the MailHog service.

Using Docker Compose to run your database locally is a pretty good idea! In my [example repo](https://github.com/dsaltares/saltares-blog-examples/tree/main/nextauth-mailhog) I went for a containerised PostgreSQL database.

```yaml
version: '3.9'

services:
  mailhog:
    image: mailhog/mailhog
    logging:
      driver: 'none' # disable saving logs
    ports:
      - 1025:1025 # smtp server
      - 8025:8025 # web ui
```

Add a couple of convenience scripts to your `package.json`.

```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "docker:up": "docker compose up -d",
    "docker:down": "docker compose down"
  }
}
```

Edit your local `.env` file to configure the NextAuth.js `EmailProvider`. Leave everything as below.

```
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=localhost
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=1025
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=email-user
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=email-pass
```

### üíª Local workflow

Bring up your containers and start the local development server.

```bash
$ yarn docker:up && yarn dev
```

Go to `https://localhost:3000`, click Sign in and enter your email.

Now you can open `http://localhost:8025/` and see the email with the magic link.

üéâ That's it, you can now manage authentication in your app and work locally without an internet connection.
