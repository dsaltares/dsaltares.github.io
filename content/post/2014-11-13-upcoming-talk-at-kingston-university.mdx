I'll be delivering a small presentation to the games development students at [Kingston University of London](http://www.kingston.ac.uk/) on Monday November 24th. The reason behind the talk is the recent publication of our [Libgdx Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook), which is why I will be giving away two hard copies! Come along to hear me preach about all Libgdx things.

Naturally, I'll post the slides here for whoever's interested.
