Ludum Dare #24 voting round is over and [**Evolution – The Survival of the fittest**](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&uid=3661) did… Okey. To be honest, this doesn’t come as a surprise at all if you look at the [postmortem](/games/ld24-evolution-postmortem/) I posted right after the jam ended. Here are the results for my entry.

*   Graphics: 3.84 #87
*   Humor: 2.62 #201
*   Audio: 2.68 #272
*   Mood: 2.67 #352
*   Theme: 2.63 #469
*   Fun: 2.21 #619
*   Overall: 2.45 #628
*   Coolness: 40% #719
*   Innovation: 1.56 #755

I’m happy to have done well in graphics because I put a lot of effort into making something visually appealing, I obviously wasted too much time on that though, people didn’t like how it played. My lowest score actually goes to the Fun category… **What’s the point of making games if they’re not fun to play?** I most definitely will try to learn the lesson towards my next take on Ludum Dare and future projects. After all, it’s all about learning, isn’t it?  

On the other side, I was a Ludum Dare virgin until now and ending up in the #620 is not a complete disaster taking into account that there were 1406 submissions.  

Anyways, it could have gone better but I’m fairly satisfied. **Next time I will aim for a much better submission**.
