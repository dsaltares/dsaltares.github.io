[PyCon ES 2017](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/), which will be running from September
22nd to September 24th in CÃ¡ceres, Spain. I'll be attending alongside some
Bloomberg colleagues as we are one of the main sponsors of the event. If you
have tickets, definitely come say hi!

I'll be helping out at a couple of presentations:

- [Bloomberg - Landing on a top Tech Tier Company](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/bloomberg-landing-on-a-top-tech-tier-company/)
- [Load test your backend with locust.io](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/schedule/load-test-your-backend-with-locustio/)

For those not coming, I'm pretty sure all the talks will be recorded
and made publicly available.
