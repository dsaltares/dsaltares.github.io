As I mentioned here a few days ago, last weekend I entered the 29th edition of the [Ludum Dare](http://www.ludumdare.com) game jam, which had _Beneath the surface_ as a theme. To be completely honest, I was only bothered to work on the project for about 4 hours each day. That probably explains why is my worst [game jam](/game-jams/) entry so far.

Beneath the surface is a very simple, classic text adventure where the player needs to escape an underground cave by using commands in the form of `verb object` like:

> Open door

The game is too basic and needed more user testing before the deadline. I was quite unhappy with it but then thought I'd rather submit it than dropping out completely. But hey, at least I managed to work on shaders a little bit, an area I really need to get better at.

Maybe next time I'll manage to pull off something better.
