Next April 22nd I'll be giving a talk at Castilla: La Mancha University (Spain). I'll be addressing the students enrolled in their [games development course](http://www.cursodesarrollovideojuegos.com/) who bother attending to listen to whatever I'm going to say.

The talk will focus on how open source projects help you get into the industry, which is something [I've been writing about lately](/computing/contribute-back-to-open-source-projects/). But I guess I'll end up talking about tangential matters such as student life as well as my experience at Crytek and Sony.

Anyway! The talk is in less than a month, which means I need to start looking into putting some slides together ASAP. I'll probably post the full presentation once it's been delivered.

**Update**: it appears that the whole thing will be filmed and posted on the University YouTube channel (oh, the pressure!). I'll speak in Spanish but I will also post the slides in English separately.
