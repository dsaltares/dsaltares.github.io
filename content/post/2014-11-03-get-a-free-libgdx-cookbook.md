In order to spread the good word of [Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook?utm_source=libdgx&utm_medium=book&utm_term=gamedev&utm_campaign=libdgx), [Alberto](https://twitter.com/omniyo) and I suggested Packt Publishing the idea of a raffle.

Simply **give us a retweet to enter the giveaway**. We'll announce the winners on Friday 7th November.
