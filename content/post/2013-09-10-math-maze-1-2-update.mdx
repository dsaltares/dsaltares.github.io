Quick update just to let you guys now that [Math Maze 1.2 is now live on the Google Play Store](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.math). This is yet another update with tweaks motivated directly by incredibly wise and valuable user feedback. Here's the small list of changes:

- Added option to disable vibration
- Now allows to move app to the SD card
- Increased help text size

I cannot thank enough those who are taking the time to play Math Maze and write a small review or send me an e-mail afterwards. I was aware of some of these little inconveniences but a few people raised new valid issues. The download count is far from being up the roof but the implication of certain users has certainly impressed me.

A side note for fellow developers. Up until now, I only knew this from articles, but acknowledging legitimate user claims by leaving a reply on Google Play and then fixing their issue is a great practise. They will show you appreciation and probably change their rating along their comment.

For the following days, the plan is to keep _"promoting"_ Math Maze to try and reach its target audience and work on some real content. That is correct, new levels!

Stay tuned.
