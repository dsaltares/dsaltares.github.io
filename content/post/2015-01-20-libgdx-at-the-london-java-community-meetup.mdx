Next Tuesday 3rd of February I will be talking about [Libgdx at the London Java Community Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/). Things won't get too technical, I'll introduce the framework, explain why it's so awesome, show who is currently using it in commercial products and give a quick demo at the end. Of course I won't miss this golden opportunity to cheekily mention my [Libgdx Cookbook](/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook/)!

If you're interested, sign up and come to the [The Skills Matter eXchange](https://www.google.com/maps?f=q&hl=en&q=116-120+Goswell+Road,+London,+gb), doors open at 6.15pm and the presentation should be around 40 minutes long.
