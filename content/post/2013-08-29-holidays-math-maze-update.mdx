Oh my… The posting rate has dangerously decreased lately! Before you judge, know that there are a couple of very good reasons for it. First and foremost, I"m on holiday, back in [Cádiz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadiz), my hometown to enjoy a little bit of sun and work on my tan. It's a small charming beautiful city with [amazing beaches](https://maps.google.com/maps?layer=c&panoid=BoFprbNbSx0AAAQIt_2eBg&cbp=1,5.0402246,,3.0,-8.579989&cbll=0,0) and prohibitively delicious places to eat .

> **Fun fact**: its [3000 years of history](http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/europes-oldest-city-is-found-394505.html) make it the oldest city in southwestern Europe. Before I took the plane, I've been working hard on [Math Maze](/games/math-maze/ "Math Maze"). Even though the code is stable, my pre launch stage task list was considerably big including level balancing, localisation and PR. 

Marketing and PR, what a pain in the arse! Indeed. Math Maze will be a free download with zero ads as I simply want it to be played by as many people as possible. To try and get some coverage for it, I had to get a lot done: Twitter and Facebook presence, press kit, screenshots, high quality trailer and write a ton of emails. At least I"m getting there.

This [GDC talk on reaching out to the press](http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/198381/How_to_talk_to_the_video_game_press_in_2013.php) and the [making of the Aquaria trailer](http://blog.kertgartner.com/2011/09/making-the-aquaria-for-ipad-teaser-trailer/) for iPad are being incredibly helpful. Good thing is, I"m learning so much with all this process. Some of the topics: localisation, filming a trailer and creating a press kit deserve a whole post each. Will try get to it once I"m done with this. Talk soon!
