Recently, I built a small React application that had a header, a navigation bar underneath and then the content. After scrolling past the header, the navigation bar was supposed to stay at the top and not scroll away.

Like so.

<CodeSandbox id="sticky-scrolling-header-vwsso" />

Making the navigation bar `position: fixed; top 0;` was not going to cut it because the header had to come first unless we scrolled past the navigation bar.

I wanted to keep the component that controls the layout as simple as possible, so I abstracted the stickiness logic into a `useSticky` [hook](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html). Here's how you'd use it.

```jsx
import classNames from 'classnames';
import useSticky from './useSticky';

export default function App() {
  const { sticky, stickyRef } = useSticky();
  return (
    <>
      <header className="header">
        <h1>Header</h1>
      </header>
      <nav ref={stickyRef} className={classNames('nav', { sticky })}>
        Sticky nav
      </nav>
      <div
        style={{
          height: sticky ? `${stickyRef.current?.clientHeight}px` : '0px',
        }}
      />
      <main className="content" />
    </>
  );
}
```

You stick (no pun intended) the `stickyRef` into the thing that you want to fix to the top after you scroll past it. Then, `sticky` will indicate whether it should be fixed at the top or not. I then use that to apply a `sticky` class.

```css
.sticky {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
}
```

The extra `div` below the `nav` adds some extra padding so that the content does not immediately jump below the navigation bar when this becomes fixed at the top.

ðŸŒŸ The magic happens in the `useSticky` hook itself.

```js
import { useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react';

const useSticky = () => {
  const stickyRef = useRef(null);
  const [sticky, setSticky] = useState(false);
  const [offset, setOffset] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (!stickyRef.current) {
      return;
    }
    setOffset(stickyRef.current.offsetTop);
  }, [stickyRef, setOffset]);

  useEffect(() => {
    const handleScroll = () => {
      if (!stickyRef.current) {
        return;
      }

      setSticky(window.scrollY > offset);
    };
    window.addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  }, [setSticky, stickyRef, offset]);
  return { stickyRef, sticky };
};

export default useSticky;
```

The first effect measures the vertical offset of the element we want to fix at the top after it's scrolled past. The second one listens to the `scroll` event and determines whether we have scrolled past the element's top edge and it needs to become sticky.

ðŸ™Œ Hope this is useful!
