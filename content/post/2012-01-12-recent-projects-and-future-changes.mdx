Lots of stuff has happened since I last posted something here. Crazy Eramus life, you want to do everything: projects, social life, studying… So, logically, the blog has been a little bit left behind. I just wanted to post a quick update about the **two university projects** I've been working on recently:

*   **[Laterdroid](/apps-tools/laterdroid/ "Laterdroid")**: Read it Later client for Android created using the official SDK.
*   **[Urban Race](/games/urban-race/ "Urban Race")**: time attack racing game developed using C# and the XNA framework.

For further information please go to each project's page, you"ll find a more detailed description, screenshots, videos and download links. I was thinking of **making both projects open source** and upload them to a Google Code repository but I guess that"ll have to wait until they"re graded by the professors.

*And now for something completely different…*

**Huge events** have taken place recently, **the dream has come true**. Unfortunately, I can't make anything public yet, I've only told my family and friends. However, I"ll soon post something on that matter.
