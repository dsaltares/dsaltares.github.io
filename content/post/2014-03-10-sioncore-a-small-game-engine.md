Today I created a repository on Gihub to keep track of my code base and I named it [SionCore](https://github.com/dsaltares/sioncore). This wasn't made overnight, it's the result of several small game projects, such as game jam gigs and [Math Maze](/games/math-maze/).

Slowly, it became obvious that some components were highly reusable and game agnostic. That is why I thought it would be good to make it public.

Who knows, maybe someday someone might even contribute!

This small _game engine_ is built on top of [Libgdx](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx) and [Ashley](https://github.com/stbachmann/ashley) among others and it's compatible with desktop, Android and iOS platforms.

### Disclaimer

SionCore is currently under heavy development, so expect constant API changes and a good deal of instability. Hopefully this one will last longer than my poorly executed previous attempts and will stabilise in a while. If that's what floats your boat, you're more than welcome on board.

Regardless of whether you use the whole thing or grab specific ideas, feedback is more than welcome.

### Features

Currently implemented and working.

  * Data driven entities
  * Entity components and system collection: rendering, animation, physics.
  * Localisation with automatic generation of template CSV files.
  * Easy screen management
  * Config files
  * Data driven sprites
  * Data driven physics
  * Grouped asset management
  * Basic state machine implementation
  * Populate your Box2D world from map data
  * Spine integration
  * Multiple aspect ratio support

### Dependencies

As of now, all the `.jar` files SionCore needs are included in the repository. However, switching to Gradle or Maven is something I want to get out of the way sooner rather than later.

### Contributing

If you find a bug or would like a particular feature, please [open an issue](https://github.com/dsaltares/sioncore/issues). On the other hand, if you want to get more involved, clone the repository and open a [pull request](https://github.com/dsaltares/sioncore/pulls)!
