Life in Kingston goes on and it's time to get some work done. [Hope Caton](http://www.hopecaton.co.uk/), who was the plot writer in [Tomb Raider IV](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider:_The_Last_Revelation) and currently works as a teacher here at Kingston University, is organizing **InKUbator**. It's a extra-curricular activity in which students can team up with the only goal of developing a great game. More on that in the following paragraphs.

InKUbator comes with extra sweetness since guest speakers from the **games industry** are coming. If this wasn't enough, students who join InKUbator might get free tickets for industry conferences in [BAFTA](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts). It's all about boosting our **portfolios**, making **connections**, working as a **team**, getting to know the **market**, challenging our **abilities** and testing our **creativity**.

We gather weekly and, although it's been roughly two weeks, I"m already excited about the direction my project is taking. It's too soon to talk what we"re working on, however I promise I"ll post details about it as soon as possible. I"m really focused in making the most of this experience, which I couldn't have access to if I wasn't in the UK as an Erasmus student.
