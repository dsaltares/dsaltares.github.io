Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook is 50% off until September 30th
if you get it from Packt's website using the code `LCPGDC50`. You have to admit
it's a total steal, considering it's the most complete and up to date Libgdx
book out there.

* Over 75 to-the-point articles that will show you how to leverage a particular
aspect of Libgdx for your game.
* Every article is accompanied by a runnable sample available on
[GitHub](https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdx-cookbook).
* We constantly [update the samples on GitHub](https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdx-cookbook/commits/master)
to stay compatible with the latest Libgdx version.

Don't have it yet? Go get it!
