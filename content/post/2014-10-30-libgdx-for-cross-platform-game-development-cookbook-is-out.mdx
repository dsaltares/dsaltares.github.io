After over a year of long hours after my day job, sweat, blood and tears, my colleague [Alberto Cejas](https://twitter.com/omniyo) and I are extremely proud to announce that our **[Libgdx for Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook has finally been published](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook)**.

The cookbook has over 75 practical recipes on how to get stuff done with [Libgdx](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/). It covers pretty much everything: graphics, input, audio, physics, maps, deployment and third-party extensions among many, many more. Far from being a dumbed down guide, it offers content ranging from basic to advanced. A good chunk of it you won't find anywhere else.

Conveniently, you can get a DRM free e-book copy or go for the physical edition, which also includes the digital one. Additionally, you can get physical copies from [Amazon](http://www.amazon.co.uk/Libgdx-Cross-platform-Game-Development-Cookbook/dp/1783287292/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1414585532&sr=8-5&keywords=david+saltares). All the source code can be downloaded from both the publisher's website and our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdx-cookbook). We'll do out best to maintain the later so it works flawlessly with the latest Libgdx version.

It's been a hell of a ride with plenty of ups and downs. We are happy with the result, have high hopes on the project's success and are eager to get some feedback from readers.

Many thanks to those of you who have shown interest in the project and even pre-ordered it. The response has been really positive!

Also, thanks to all our technical reviewers, you greatly helped improved the final result with your feedback.

Lastly, special thanks to [Mario](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames) and the [Libgdx team](https://github.com/orgs/libgdx/teams/owners) for fostering the best open source game development framework and community. Needless to say, this book wouldn't exist without them.

Happy coding!
