I've been really busy with the development of [Sion Tower](/en/proyectos/sion-tower/) but it's also been possible to spend some time working in [gLapse](/en/proyectos/glapse/). After introducing new stuff and fixing broken pieces, I"m proud to announce **the third release of the GNU/Linux time lapse tool: gLapse v0.3!** Continue reading to find about its new features and to get download links.

### Changelog

- Improves video quality but the slider to configure it had to be deleted.
- French translation thanks to my little sister.
- Japanese translation thanks to [@jjbernalr](http://twitter.com/#!/jjbernalr).
- Updates other translations.
- Bugfixes (see [SVN log](http://code.google.com/p/glapse/source/list) for more details).
