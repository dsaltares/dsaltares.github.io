As I have mentioned [before](/projects/libgdx-cross-platform-development-cookbook-announced/), I have been working on a book titled [Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook](/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook/), which is set to be released next month.

Me and my co-author Alberto used a Git repository throughout the text and sample code development process. Using [Gource](https://github.com/acaudwell/Gource), I have created a video that illustrates the repository's evolution. Neat, isn't it?

For those interested, here are the options I used.
