Let's face it, the old theme was extremely 2005. It was about time this blog got a proper facelift.

Since I'm no designer, I put together all my creativity and went for one of the featured WordPress themes, [Twenty Thirteen](http://wordpress.org/themes/twentythirteen). But that's okay because the awesomeness of my content makes up for the lack of innovation.

> Ha!

Now seriously, I thought a colorful and yet simple style would do this place some good. Twenty Thirteen is modern, slick and clean. The mobile version works really well too!Â It might not be the most glorious display of originality but I like it and that's all that really matters. Of course, I hope whoever reads this doesn't find it too unpleasant.

For a while, I even considered divorcing WordPress entirely and go for something more minimalistic such as [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) or [Ghost](https://ghost.org/). However, when I looked into the actual setup, I decided I couldn't be bothered. Simplicity is beautiful and WordPress is kind of a Behemoth. A monster that works and makes my life easy, nonetheless.
