  It&#8217;s been a while since I wrote anything on the blog but hey, this time I have an excuse. I&#8217;m in Kingston Upon Thames (London) to study computing science and games development for a whole year with an Erasmus exchange scholarship. I arrived on September the 13th and since then, it&#8217;s been a nonstop of activities: tourism, paperwork, parties, meeting people, housework, etc. Finally I can sit for a while to write this.

    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kingston_upon_Thames">Kingston Upon Thames</a> is a little city in southwest London, the advantage of its reduced extension is that you can walk almost everywhere. However is also really close to Central London, if you catch a train (there&#8217;s one each 15 minutes) you&#8217;ll be in Waterloo station in about 20 minutes. So far I think it&#8217;s a great combination. I live in a hall of residence, specifically in a flat shared with other 5 international students, such a great place to meet new people and party! My hall is 5 minutes walking from the center, which has a nice main street full of shops. Of course, I couldn&#8217;t forget the pubs and clubs. Although they close extremely early, we always have a great time hanging out there. It&#8217;s real fun when we gather to watch a football (soccer if you&#8217;re American) game while drinking a pint!

      Computing science is taught at the main campus which is called Penrhyn Road, 15 minutes away if you walk. I was amazed with the huge amount of money they should invest to have proper facilities: a huge library, great fully equipped labs and comfortable classrooms. It&#8217;s unbelievable how active the people is around here, there are students societies for almost everything you can imagine: DJs, skydiving, fencing, cake eating, wine tasting, gaming, market investment&#8230; And the list goes on!

        I&#8217;ve chosen 4 modules in computing science and 4 in games development, so it&#8217;s going to be some kind of mixture. I&#8217;m very excited because the year looks really promising! I&#8217;ll try to learn as much as possible not only in games development but in other skills such as English, speaking in public, teamwork, etc.

        I&#8217;ll keep you posted!
