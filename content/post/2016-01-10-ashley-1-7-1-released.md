There's a new [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) release, check the changes for [1.7.1](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/releases/tag/ashley-1.7.1) below:

* **[API addition](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/5277cbe83264d0ddc851a823232f51c350e9c387)**: expose `IntervalSystem` interval value (read-only).
* **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/197)**: fixed pending entity operations not being processed in the right order.
* **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/203)**: fixed adding component in empty family `EntityListener` causing wrong `EntityListener` calls.
* **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/c45ba3b34860121571eb9a660a76bc82ac0a1a96)**: fixed some entity operations not being performed under special circumstances.
* **[Internals](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/178)**: split Engine internals into loosely coupled, single responsibility smaller classes.
* **[Update](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/92fa5c7179bf77a39a81cf20a5328a2fc4ca8c5f)**: uses Libgdx 1.8.0.

To use it, change your dependency to `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.7.1`. The new nightly dependency is `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.7.2-SNAPSHOT`.

It's really motivating to see how many people are using Ashley in their projects,
including for the [#LibGDXJAM](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=libgdxjam%20ashley&src=typd)!
