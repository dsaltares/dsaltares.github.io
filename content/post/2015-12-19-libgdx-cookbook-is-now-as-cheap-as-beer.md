This holiday season you can buy [Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook) just for what a beer would set you back! It's either £4, $6 or 5€ until January 6th. So, do you liver a favour, don't down that extra pint and learn Libgdx! Remember we keep our samples up to date with the latest Libgdx releases on [GitHub](https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdx-cookbook).

Happy holidays!
