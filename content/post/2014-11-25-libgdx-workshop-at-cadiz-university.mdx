[Alberto Cejas](https://twitter.com/omniyo), colleague and co-author of [Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook) delivered a Libgdx workshop at Cadiz University (Spain) last Friday 21st of November.

During a 2 hour session, the students put together a bunch of pieces to build Flappy Plane, a Flappy Bird clone originally developed by [Mario Zechner](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames). Moreover, there was free stuff! Alberto did a small raffle and gave two copies of our book away.

We're really happy with the turnout, just take a look at the gallery below!

If you're interested in an easy introduction to Libgdx, feel free to check the [GitHub repo](https://github.com/AlbertoCejas/flappybird_workshop) where we've uploaded everything: [slides](https://github.com/AlbertoCejas/flappybird_workshop/blob/master/slides/slides_english.pdf?raw=true), code and exercises.

Many thanks to everyone who turned up!
