Just a quick update, you really should spend a few minutes watching this presentation. Johan Andersson, Rendering architech at DICE, gave a talk called **"Shiny PC graphics in Battlefield 3"** during the last nVidia GeForce LAN. It's focused on the latest improvements the [Frostbite 2](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite_(game_engine)>) engine includes and I think it's a pretty good example of where the graphics technology is going.
