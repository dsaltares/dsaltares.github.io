As I recently [mentioned](/games/libgdx-at-intel-buzz-workshop-stockholm-2015/),
a couple of weeks ago I flew to Stockholm to attend the
[Intel Buzz Workshop](https://software.intel.com/en-us/event/buzzworkshop), a conference
focused on mobile games development where I preached the perks of Libgdx.
The event had a great turnout and my talk seemed to have been well received.
Moreover, I also got to meet cool people [IRL](http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=IRL) such as [Adrian](https://github.com/junkdog), the guy behind the [Artemis ECS](https://github.com/junkdog/artemis-odb).

For those who missed it and would like to watch me ramble about how brilliant
Libgdx is for a whole 20 minutes, here is the video.

Make sure you check out the
[full event playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLuP4XLxfL4Q6dwHc84_fb4IW6XGWGKr-v),
there is quite a bit of good material there! Take a look at the
[full event gallery](https://www.flickr.com/photos/bemyapp/sets/72157655838021780/) and be
all jealous of how much fun people had.

Conveniently, the event was on a Friday, which gave me the rest of the weekend to visit Stockholm. Lovely archipelago-city, boats, bridges, nice medieval buildings and fresh fish. Definitely do not miss the Vasa and the Nobel museums.

Finally, I couldn't possibly go without thanking the organisers,
[BeMyAp](https://twitter.com/bemyapp) in general and [Johanne](https://fr.linkedin.com/pub/johanne-mamet/47/558/199/en)
in particular who was awesome in making sure everything was flawless.
The opportunity was much appreciated! Oh! They"re preparing a [similar event in Berlin](http://intelbuzz.bemyapp.com/berlin/) on September 22nd, sign up for it if you missed this one.
