We"re halfway through the [#libGDXJAM](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=libgdxjam) and some work has been done between Christmas and New Year's eve.

Here's a few updates.

- [@DrillerDev](https://twitter.com/DrillerDev) as joined us as an artist and has already produced some awesome concepts.
- Alberto and I have been working on an Overlap2D scene loader and it's pretty much working supporting a bunch of things: composites, textures, lights, physics and particles.
- We have a somewhat buggy physics based platformer movement system.
- There are cameras you have to stay away from!

We really need to focus on gameplay now, hopefully we"ll have something playable by the deadline. Make sure to follow the [Twitter feed](https://twitter.com/search?src=typd&q=libgdxjam) for the jam. Gotta say that I"m shocked to see how much coolness people have managed to put together in such a short amount of time.
