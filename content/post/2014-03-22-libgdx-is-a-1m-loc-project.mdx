Don't exactly remember how, but last night I came across [Code Analyzer](http://sourceforge.net/projects/codeanalyze-gpl/), an open source Java desktop utility that counts lines of code. Out of curiosity, I downloaded the runnable jar file and tried it with Libgdx.

I was very much aware that Libgdx was a pretty big project but certainly didn't expect it to be that large. At the time of writing the `HEAD` of the repository contains 1.048.646 lines of Java, C and C++. 712.016 of which are actual code, 17% are comments while the rest are just whitespaces.

Not bad, huh?

Although this is obviously not a quality indicator, it shows how big of a baby it is.

There you go, your fun fact of the day.
