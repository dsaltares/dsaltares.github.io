I've just finished this simple **flocking behavior demo** based on the [3 Reynolds rules](<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flocking_(behavior)>): separation, cohesion and alignment. It was part of a coursework for the _Strategy & Intelligent Games_ module I"m taking here in Kingston University. I know it's not precisely pretty but at least the boids are moving in a nice way. It's written in C++ using the despicable [Open Scene Graph](http://www.openscenegraph.org/) library (such an uncomfortable API).

**Features**:

- 3 Reynolds rules: separation, cohesion and alignment.
- Collision avoidance.
- User interaction: dynamic mouse seeking or avoidance.
- Steering behaviors blending.
- Configurable parameters using an XML options file.

Most of the algorithms have been extracted from the _Artificial Intelligence for Games_ book written by Ian Millington and John Funge. If you"re interested in the topic it's totally a must read, I strongly recommend it.
