I'm up for Ludum Dare despite not being too sure about whether or not I'll be able to invest enough time on it. The last couple of editions eluded me, so I didn't want to miss yet another one.

Given the time constraints, I might even go for just a text adventure. Or maybe not, who knows. I'll decide in the morning, once the theme is announced!

Tools of the trade.

  * **Language**: Java with Eclipse
  * **Libraries**: [Libgdx](libgdx.badlogicgames.com) (what a surprise) with no previous codebase. I might use additional libraries if needed, though.
  * **Graphics**: [Inkscape](http://www.inkscape.org/en/)
  * **Audio**: [Audacity](http://audacity.sourceforge.net/), [SFXR](http://www.drpetter.se/project_sfxr.html) and [this procedural music generator](http://www.abundant-music.com/)

It is on!
