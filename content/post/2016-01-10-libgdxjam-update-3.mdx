Oh my God, enter panic mode, just 8 days left until the [#LibGDXJAM](https://twitter.com/search?f=tweets&vertical=default&q=libgdxjam&src=typd) deadline! We've been [hard at work](https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdxjam/commits/master), especially [@DrillerDev](https://twitter.com/DrillerDev) who's pushed the character design and animation.

Look at this bad boy for instance, better not to mess with his alien gun.

Or the beholder powered alien surveillance.

Please, ignore the placeholder environment art, it's the textures from the Overlap2D example project. Our chubby astronaut can run, crouch, jump and push boxes around. We've also worked on a nice look-ahead camera target tracking system. That way the player knows where the character is going and anticipate dangers.

One of the ways to avoid CCTV cameras is to prone behind a crate and push it whilst remaining hidden.

We"re now focusing on enemy behaviours and level design.
