Time for another [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) entity framework [release](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/releases/tag/ashley-1.3.0)! This time, the focus has been on stability by getting rid of as many bugs as we could find. Check all the new goodies below.

  * **[API addition](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/47bf907b15ad8ed4297a10eb6b6b311e1542dcb8)**: adds `IntervalSystem` and `IntervalIteratingSystem`, which are updated at a fixed interval.
  * **[API addition](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/f1ccdbea63a175f2a76c26b46661998b6a131c59)**: adds `getEntities()` to `IteratingSystem` and `IntervalIteratingSystem`.
  * **[API change](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/6f9d2b78c34f72d03e76d40c8d9704f1c763e59a)**: entities use `long` as ID. Changes `entity.getIndex()` for `entity.getId()`. Ids are reset to 0 after the entity is removed from the engine.
  * **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/a2a63f4e42e09e3221331b2333e675b3a4ab6fe3)**: we finally got rid of the issues related to deleting entities and adding/removing components mid system processing.
  * **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/64)**: fixes problem with removing pooled entities.
  * **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/pull/72)**: fixes pooled entities not being fully reset.
  * **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/9a01938713946cad0c31d21ecb723443ccf6b2ff)**: fixes broken GWT compatibility.

The new nightly dependency is `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.3.1-SNAPSHOT`.
