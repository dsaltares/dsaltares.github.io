  Life in Kingston goes on and it&#8217;s time to get some work done. <a href="http://www.hopecaton.co.uk/">Hope Caton</a>, who was the plot writer in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tomb_Raider:_The_Last_Revelation">Tomb Raider IV</a> and currently works as a teacher here at Kingston University, is organizing <strong>InKUbator</strong>. It&#8217;s a extra-curricular activity in which students can team up with the only goal of developing a great game. More on that in the following paragraphs.

  InKUbator comes with extra sweetness since guest speakers from the <strong>games industry</strong> are coming. If this wasn&#8217;t enough, students who join InKUbator might get free tickets for industry conferences in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/British_Academy_of_Film_and_Television_Arts">BAFTA</a>. It&#8217;s all about boosting our <strong>portfolios</strong>, making <strong>connections</strong>, working as a <strong>team</strong>, getting to know the <strong>market</strong>, challenging our <strong>abilities</strong> and testing our <strong>creativity</strong>.

  We gather weekly and, although it&#8217;s been roughly two weeks, I&#8217;m already excited about the direction my project is taking. It&#8217;s too soon to talk what we&#8217;re working on, however I promise I&#8217;ll post details about it as soon as possible. I&#8217;m really focused in making the most of this experience, which I couldn&#8217;t have access to if I wasn&#8217;t in the UK as an Erasmus student.
