[Ludum Dare #24](/games/ld24-evolution-postmortem/ 'LD#24 â€“ Evolution Postmortem') was my first game jam, an experience I found most enjoyable. Sadly, I couldn't make it to its 25th edition. However, unless something major happens, I"m totally in for [Ludum Dare #26](http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/category/ld-26/) which will take place next weekend. Aiming at respecting tradition I shall post my arsenal of choice, unsurprisingly, they are as follow.

- **Environment**: Java + Eclipse.
- **Libraries**: libgdx & friends, maybe something from my [codebase](https://github.com/dsaltares).
- **Graphics**: Inkscape, TexturePacker and Flash if I require animations.
- **Audio**: Audacity and the dodgy effects produced by sfxr.
- **Others**: depending on game details I could use Tiled for level design, Photoshop.

The goal is to finish a game that sucks as less as possible while retaining my mental sanity and some physical health. That means going for a jog each day and keeping the caffeine intake under control.

Keeping things short, I"ll be posting progress updates on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/siondream) all weekend and a proper postmortem article will follow on this very blog.
