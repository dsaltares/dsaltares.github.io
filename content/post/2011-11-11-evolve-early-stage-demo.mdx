Yesterday I had an **in class demo** at university of my **PSP First Person Shooter prototype, [Evolve](/games/evolve-psp-project/ 'Evolve: PSP project')**. The professor was impressed with the software engineering behind the system so, apparently, it went quite well although the project is in a very early stage of development. As always, I was in the games lab (it's becoming my second home), so I recorded a video of the demo to keep track of the process.
