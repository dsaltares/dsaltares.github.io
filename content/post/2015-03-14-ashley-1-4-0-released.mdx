A new version of [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley), your favourite component based entity framework is out. The [1.4.0](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/releases/tag/ashley-1.4.0) version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.

- **[API deprecation](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/d6222d9ee0cca6f06dd61b04bae6d092497425a5)**: finallt removed the `Family.getFor()` methods. In order to retrieve a family, you can do `Family.all().one().exclude().get()`.
- **[API change](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/137)**: makes family `Builder` package protected.
- **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/356cf4097f7c870cccc67cffca62ff3f32f103da)**: `EntityOperation` and `ComponentOperation` are now properly reset when put back into their pools. This doesn't affect the API at all and it's an implementation detail fix.
- **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/eff243f65e98a57c5e1a8045f85465cd1acf085d)**: fixes `PooledEngine` always returning new components.
- **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/135)**: fixes GWT build.
- **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/cf7a02006d2269cd64976de6e7b56bd7553708de)**: avoids removing a `PooledEntity` twice.

To use it, change your dependency to `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.4.0`. The new nightly dependency is `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.4.1-SNAPSHOT`.

As usual, [all unit tests are passing](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com:8080/job/ashley/) and the wiki is up to date. Please keep up the good work sending more pull requests and reporting bugs.
