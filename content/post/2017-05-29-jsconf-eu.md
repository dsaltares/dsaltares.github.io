[JSConf EU](http://2017.jsconf.eu/) is one of the biggest JS conferences
in Europe and I was lucky enough to attend its 2017 edition earlier this
month. This year the event took place in [Arena Berlin](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Arena+Berlin/@52.4971901,13.448364,16.92z/data=!4m8!1m2!2m1!1sdie+arena+berlin!3m4!1s0x0:0x6852fd9350063186!8m2!3d52.4969238!4d13.4539819),
a place by the river, typically dedicated to concerts in the east side
of the German capital.

Overall, it was a pretty awesome weekend and although I wish there were
more talks on advanced technical topics, I understand the event is more
focused on community and diversity. It was flawlessly organised, special
kudos for the attention to disabilities, the timeliness, quality of
the food and free beer!

Below are my favorite talks.
