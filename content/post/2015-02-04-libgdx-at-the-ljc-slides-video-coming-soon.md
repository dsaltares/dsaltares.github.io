Yesterday, I had the pleasure to deliver a talk about Libgdx at the [London Java Community Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Londonjavacommunity/). To my surprise, there was a pretty decent turnout. The audience was lovely, seemed engaged and asked quite a few questions. No awkward silence at the end.

> Woohoo! 

Thanks a lot to everyone who attended, and to the organisers who made it possible. We must catch up next time at the pub afterwards!

If you're in the London area, you should definitely join the Meetup group and attend some of the talks. The atmosphere is friendly and there's at least one every week, the next ones are on [Ceylon](http://ceylon-lang.org/) and design patterns.

Here's the video and the slides:
