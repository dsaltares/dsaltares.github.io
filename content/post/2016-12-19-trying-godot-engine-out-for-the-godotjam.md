[Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org) caught my eye a while back as a serious
open source alternative to the ubiquitous Unity. Some of you may know I've been
involved with the Libgdx project for some time, I even wrote a
[book](/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook) about it!

There's nothing wrong with Libgdx, I absolutely love the project and the
more than welcoming community around it.

The problem is that shipping a game is hard. Doing so whilst working a full
time job is harder. Adding a semi-decent social life to the mix makes it
a mighty quest. There's no such thing as too much help when it comes to
such venture. Consequently, the tooling around a fully featured engine
is hardly beatable.

Personally, I felt slightly uncomfortable working with Unity because of
its proprietary nature. However, the fact that there was no competitive
open source alternative out there really annoyed me too.

That's why Godot has a strong appeal.

Last week, they announced the [Godot Community Jam](https://godotengine.org/article/godot-gamejam-dec-2016-jan-2017),
which started on December 16th and will continue until January 31st.
It's hosted on [itch.io](https://itch.io/jam/godotjam122016) and people
will be using [#godotjam](https://twitter.com/hashtag/godotjam?src=hash)
on Twitter.

Looks like a great opportunity to learn the engine to me.

There's enough time to put something together, even for a total n00b
like me. Moreover, the theme \*2 buttons" encourages simplicity and
the rules are pretty lose.

I have a very rough idea of what I want to do, so it's time to get
to work.

Will report back!
