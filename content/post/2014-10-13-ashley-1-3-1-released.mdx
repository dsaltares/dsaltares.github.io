Small stability [release](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/releases/tag/ashley-1.3.1) for [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) entity framework this time.

**[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/77)**: fixed `IllegalArgumentException` thrown when trying to remove components from an already reset entity. The call has no effect now. Thanks for that [SgtCoDFish](https://github.com/SgtCoDFish).

**[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/78)**: fixed family match failure due to silly silly hashing.

**[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/82)**: fixed `entity.getId()` always returning `` for recycled pooled entities.

**[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/81)**: fixed nested iteration problem caused by adding/removing entities from an entity added/removed listener handler.

**[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/cb3347239504972b86653efab8d9051ec5366760)**: fixed missing type error in GWT when using `PooledEngine`. GWT should be quite smooth now.

The new nightly dependency is `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.3.2-SNAPSHOT`.

Big thanks to everyone who reported issues and especially to those who also contributed with PRs. Keep it up!
