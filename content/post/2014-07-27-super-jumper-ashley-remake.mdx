[Ashley Super Jumper](https://github.com/dsaltares/ashley-superjumper) has been my weekend project. It is nothing more than a clone of the [Libgdx demo game](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx-demo-superjumper). The catch is that it goes for an entity system approach rather than the classic inheritance model. Naturally, it uses Ashley.

The point was to have a reference project folks could check out in order to understand how entity systems in general and Ashley in particular work.

Maybe one day, I'll post a proper article explaining the design behind the entity systems at play in Super Jumper. I guess that could be useful.
