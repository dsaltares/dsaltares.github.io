[Last night](https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/commit/dfbb2dc4c5a146f5255bc358a7c8a591735bff3f) I added Ashley support to the official [Libgdx setup tool](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/dist/gdx-setup.jar). Creating Libgdx projects that use Ashley entity framework is now even easier. Simply make sure you tick the Ashley checkbox before generating your project.

By the way, if you already have a a project, adding the extra dependency is also trivial.

- Core project: `com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1`
- Android project: `com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1`
- GWT project: `com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1:sources`

Remember that using Ashley in non Libgdx projects is also perfectly fine.
