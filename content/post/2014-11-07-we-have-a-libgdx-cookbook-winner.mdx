To celebrate the release of our [Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook) we announced a [raffle](/projects/get-a-free-libgdx-cookbook/) on Twitter earlier this week. A few RTs later and a random number generation, the winner is.

Congratulations, we'll get in touch with the winner to send him his paperback copy.

Here's proof that everything was legit:
