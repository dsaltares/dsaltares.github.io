Loads of stuff in the pipeline lately: new job, finishing [my book](/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook/) and some [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) development. What? You don't know what Ashley is? Here is a brief, straight from GitHub.

> A tiny [entity framework](http://entity-systems.wikidot.com/) written in Java. It's inspired by frameworks like [Ash](http://www.ashframework.org/) (hence the name) and [Artemis](http://gamadu.com/artemis/). Ashley tries to be a high-performance entity framework without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy and transparent to use. 

Long story short: Ashley is awesome.

[Stefan Batchmann](https://github.com/stbachmann) started the project on February 2013. Since [he is rather busy making actual games](http://robotality.com/blog/), he asked me to look after the project and I gladly accepted.

Entity systems are really cool and can help you write cleaner game code, avoiding the classic inheritance hierarchy hell. [This article](http://www.richardlord.net/blog/what-is-an-entity-framework) does a pretty good job at explaining the benefits of entity systems.

It's funny how strongly opinionated developers seem to feel towards entity systems. Some love them, some hate them. Have a read, experiment with Ashley and decide for yourself.

The [readme](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/blob/master/README.md) will help to you get started. Please, do not hesitate to [open an issue](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues?state=open) if you find any problems. If you send a [pull request](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/pulls), you will have our unconditional love.

Expect more Ashley related articles soon!
