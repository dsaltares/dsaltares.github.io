After a [crazy weekend before the deadline](https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdxjam/commits/master), we finally managed to put something playable together for [LibGDXJAM](http://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam).

We"d love you to have a go, and leave some [feedback](http://itch.io/jam/libgdxjam/rate/51210).

We are definitely aware of the shortcomings of the game. We spent a lot of the jam working on a custom [Overlap2D](http://overlap2d.com/) level loader and not so much on actual content, so you can actually finish the game in under a minute. I guess the difficulty (or lack of readability) may make it slightly longer, which is also a bit bad. The movement system could have done with a bit more fine tuning as well.

However, we do believe the game has potential! Thanks to [@DrillerDev](https://twitter.com/DrillerDev), we had great character art an animations. The mechanics offer nice possibilities, which currently remain hidden due to lack of content. Not to mention the humour opportunities and the characters" comicality.

I will try post some technical articles on the project. We used [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) and some folks may find interesting how we tackled certain details such as the scene hierarchy or the animation selection system.

Next time we should follow the advice [@McFunkypants](https://twitter.com/McFunkypants) gives in [The Game Jam Survival Guide](https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/game-jam-survival-guide)!
