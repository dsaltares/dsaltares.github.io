[PyCon ES 2017](https://2017.es.pycon.org/en/) was an absolute blast!

The talks were very interesting and they're all freely available on their
[Youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8QYnf8EVoRc&list=PLahUDl6AAwrhc_qBiZpn07_7tDZnapO9C).

Celebrating PyCon ES 2017 in [Caceres](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A1ceres,_Spain),
located in southern Spain, was a great choice. Beautiful medieval city center where [some
scenes in Game of Thrones were filmed](https://winteriscoming.net/2016/12/16/final-images-caceres-season-7-game-thrones/),
plus cheap and delicious food.

The conference itself was hosted at an old monastery, repurposed for these kind
of events. I honestly have never been to a conference with such a cool venue!

My colleague [Andy](https://twitter.com/andyalmonte31) and I gave a
presentation titled _"Load test your backend services with locust.io"_, watch it!
