Almost a year ago, I started working on a Libgdx recipe book with Alberto Cejas, an old University mate. Now, Packt Publishing, have announced the project on their website, **[Libgdx Cross-platform Development Cookbook](http://www.packtpub.com/libgdx-cross-platform-development-cookbook/book)**.

You can even pre-order a printed copy or the e-book version (DRM free).

Exciting times!

The book offers step-by-step guides on how to master Libgdx subsystems to build 2D games that run almost everywhere: Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers. It only requires basic knowledge of games development and comes with a ton of sample code to help readers understand each topic.

I will post more information soon!
