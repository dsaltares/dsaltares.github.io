There's a new [Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley) release, check the changes for
[1.7.0](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/releases/tag/ashley-1.7.0) below:

- **[API change](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/182)**: removed UUIDs from entities, users should implement their own ID system when needed. This helps with networked games.
- **[Update](84de67991b343828c668985bd1cd5a4a1309cafa)**: components are added/removed immediately, listeners are notified after the current system finishes updating.
- **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/b611dd98e28f4dc15d64b7340c8d507ba29153d5)**: fixed entity listeners not being called if a component is added inside another listener.
- **[Bug fix](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/9ae5e459b437d7a51bfc48283cf5cd20e82989f9)**: does not allocate memory inside `updateFamilyMembership()`.
- **[Update](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/4799007c457f714ad9fe0ad606a4a0f25b825ab7)**: uses Libgdx 1.7.1.

To use it, change your dependency to `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.7.0`.
The new nightly dependency is `com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.7.1-SNAPSHOT`.

Next, I am going to be focusing on code quality and maintainability. Particularly, try
and [split `Engine`](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/178) internally into smaller
logical components whilst keeping the API intact.

As usual, [all unit tests are passing](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com:8080/job/ashley/)
and the wiki is up to date. Please keep up the good work sending more pull
requests and reporting bugs!
