[Ashley](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley), your favourite entity framework now has online [javadocs](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/ashley/docs/) and a [wiki](https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/wiki).

> Wooohooo! 

The javadocs correspond to the latest repository snapshot. Our [Jenkins](libgdx.badlogicgames.com:8080/job/ashley/) instance grabs the code, runs the tests, builds the jars and publishes the javadocs to the [badlogic.com](http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com) server. Kudos to [Mario](https://twitter.com/badlogicgames) for the setup.

I just started putting stuff into the wiki yesterday so it's pretty empty as of now. Expect more content soon!
