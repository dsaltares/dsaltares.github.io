</p>
<p>To err is human, and I certainly have made my share of mistakes in my career as an engineering leader. Undoubtedly, I still have quite a few yet to make. Like with software incidents, it is vital to <a href="./a-template-for-great-incident-reviews">reflect and learn from mistakes</a>, so that our system becomes more robust and we grow as professionals.</p>
<p>Today, I thought it would be interesting to go through 6 mistakes I have made as an engineering leader.</p>
<h3 id="1-skipping-1-1s">1. Skipping 1-1s</h3>
<p>Skipping 1-1s was never really a habit for me. I’ve always made it a priority to be available for my team. However, I’ve had reports who didn’t take enough ownership over their 1-1s. When that time of the week came, I would sometimes get a chat message:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hey, I don’t have anything for 1-1 today. Shall we skip it?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We were super busy, so agreeing was highly tempting. In doing so, I was missing out on the opportunity to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Share my expectations and feedback around 1-1 ownership.</li>
<li>Empower and motivate the individual.</li>
<li>Set goals and maintain accountability.</li>
</ul>
<p>Later, I learned to ask <a href="https://lauratacho.com/blog/how-can-i-make-my-1-1s-less-boring">better questions</a>, put the individuals in the driver&rsquo;s seat, and make the most of 1-1s.</p>
<h3 id="2-underestimating-having-a-clear-technology-strategy">2. Underestimating having a clear technology strategy</h3>
<p>Many managers dictate and involve themselves in every technical decision their teams make. I want to empower my teams to make their own decisions and genuinely have agency over the software they build, ship and maintain. However, for multiple squads to do that consistently, you need a couple of things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Excellent communication across teams/squads.</li>
<li>A clear technology vision and strategy.</li>
</ul>
<p>It took me too long to support my teams by sharing a clear technology vision and strategy that would become the principles on which they could base technical decisions. Once I did that, it felt like magic. We were all rowing our technology in the same direction.</p>
<p>It doesn’t need to be too comprehensive. Just be clear about the kinds of tradeoffs you want the team to make. I will dive deeper into this one at some point with a separate article.</p>
<h3 id="3-not-setting-clear-expectations">3. Not setting clear expectations</h3>
<p>There have been instances where an individual was surprised when receiving feedback from me. That is usually a robust signal that expectations were not clear enough. As long as expectations are clear, folks have enough self-awareness to reflect and identify a problem after receiving feedback about something not working out great.</p>
<p>Making the expectations of each role in your organization public is a fantastic tool.</p>
<ul>
<li>Help everyone understand what is expected of them.</li>
<li>Increase equity, people in the same role are not evaluated against different standards.</li>
<li>Greater understading of what it takes to progress.</li>
<li>When shared externally, it can be a great recruiting tool.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you should complement this with <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/coaching-and-feedback/running-one-on-ones">great 1-1 sessions</a>, good cross-team understanding of roles and responsibilities, etc.</p>
<h3 id="4-not-hiring-engineering-managers-first">4. Not hiring Engineering Managers first</h3>
<p>Back in January 2021, I found myself in the position to increase capacity fast. To do that, I had to <a href="./how-to-hire-8-engineers-in-8-weeks">grow the Aula engineering team from 7 to 25 in record time</a>.</p>
<p>Yikes!</p>
<p>I knew hiring Engineers was hard, but finding fantastic Engineering Managers (EMs) is much worse. In Europe, managers also tend to have longer notice periods, up to 3 months!. The pressure to increase capacity was so high that I mistakenly prioritized individual contributor (IC) roles over the manager ones.</p>
<p>As a consequence, my team grew well beyond my management capacity. If I remember correctly, I had 15 reports at one point. I still had to do all these Engineering Manager interviews, so the quality of my feedback went down, and it became increasingly hard to help the team push in the same direction.</p>
<p>What would have happened if I had focused on increasing managerial capacity first? Maybe short-term velocity would not have gone up, but I would have achieved a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Much higher hiring capacity with lower pressure on ICs.</li>
<li>Significant improvements to feedback.</li>
<li>Greater alignment across product squads.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="5-not-investing-enough-in-team-building">5. Not investing enough in team building</h3>
<p>In a rapidly growing organization, folks start working closely with other people they do not know at all. Even though everyone works hard, software delivery does not progress as expected.</p>
<p>There is no trust.</p>
<p>Not because you hired the wrong people, but simply because you have made no room for individuals to build trust with each other. Thanks to the feedback I received, we invested much more in getting to know each other and building that trust. The team gelled and worked much more effectively together after that.</p>
<p>🙌 Thanks for reading. Hopefully, some of these have provided you with some insight.</p>

</p>
<p>Incident response can be stressful. The system is on fire, the team has to fix it ASAP, and you&rsquo;re working against the clock. Your users are getting frustrated, the company loses money, stakeholders constantly check for updates, and trust is at risk. What a nightmare!</p>
<p>The tension is so high that the incident responder forgets to communicate effectively or is so worried about keeping folks up to date that they take the wrong action, further compromising the system.</p>
<p>Your team may greatly benefit from an incident playbook at times like this. When a new incident kicks off, the responder creates a new document from a template. This document serves as a guide on how to respond to the incident. It removes a lot of stress from the situation and helps the team resolve the problem faster.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://plot.co">Plot</a>, we have a Notion template for our incidents that looks something like this.</p>
<h3 id="checklist">✅ Checklist</h3>
<p>The responder ticks off actions as they go through them.</p>
<span class="begin-task-list"></span>

<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Assign yourself and acknowledge the alert or the issue.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Start populating the log below.</li>
</ul>
<p>Start communications:</p>
<span class="begin-task-list"></span>

<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Post a message in the <code>#downtime</code> Slack channel about the active outage.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Start a call to better coordinate and send the link to the <code>#engineering</code> Slack channel.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Update status page.</li>
</ul>
<p>Work on the issue:</p>
<span class="begin-task-list"></span>

<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> If you need help from a team member with domain expertise, page them.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> First, stabilize the system.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Then, resolve the issue.</li>
</ul>
<p>When the issue is resolved:</p>
<span class="begin-task-list"></span>

<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Update status page.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Update the <code>#downtime</code> channel.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Write an incident review doc and share it in <code>#downtime</code>.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox"> Schedule an incident review call with the engineering team.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-log">✍️ Log</h3>
<p>Populating the following log during the incident helps the responder put together an <a href="./a-template-for-great-incident-reviews">incident review document</a>.</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th>Finding or action taken</th>
<th>Details</th>
<th>Timestamp</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>Alert triggered</td>
<td><code>&lt;link&gt;</code></td>
<td>March 11, 2022 10:17</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h3 id="-additional-tips-for-the-incident-responder">🚀 Additional tips for the incident responder</h3>
<ul>
<li>🤝 You are not alone in this. Ask for help if you need it and delegate.</li>
<li>🗣 High severity incidents: consider making some other team member the owner of communications so that you can focus on the other steps.</li>
<li>🔐 Security incidents: choose appropriate wording for public communications to avoid the vulnerability from being exploited further.</li>
<li>⚠️ If you stop being available during an incident, put a continuity plan is in place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you can adapt this template to your needs. The main idea is that having a checklist in the first place avoids stress when responding to a problem.</p>
<p>🙌 Thanks for reading! I would love to hear from you if you have any thoughts around checklists for incident response.</p>

</p>
<p>Software incidents suck big time. Suddenly, you have more work to do; the sprint is derailed; stakeholders raise their eyebrows and start asking questions. Nobody wants that! Unfortunately, incidents do happen. Complex software systems are bound to fail from time to time.</p>
<p>An incident can also be an opportunity. Your job is to make sure to seize it. <strong>Incident review docs</strong> followed by a discussion help a lot. Above all else, the main goal of incident reviews is to <strong>learn</strong>, although great incident reviews can achieve much more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify ways to make the system more robust.</li>
<li>Identify and close process gaps.</li>
<li>Learn about the system they maintain and develop.</li>
<li>Protect the trust with the rest of the company and customers by being transparent.</li>
<li>Understand user impact better and develop user empathy.</li>
<li>Help future team members understand the systems&rsquo; weak points and how incidents are handled.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend the following approach, which <a href="./6-tips-to-make-remote-meetings-more-inclusive/">makes the process more inclusive</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The incident leader/responder writes the review doc.</li>
<li>The team reads and comments async.</li>
<li>Everyone gets together to reflect and align on actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an incident review doc template that has worked well in my teams.</p>
<h3 id="-authors">✍️ Authors</h3>
<p>List the people who put the incident review document together. It will help future readers know who to ask for more information.</p>
<h3 id="-summary">🗞️ Summary</h3>
<p>Write out the TLDR version of what happened.</p>
<h3 id="-impact">🔥 Impact</h3>
<p>When talking about impact, you should consider several dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li>🚶‍♂️ <strong>User</strong>: were users unable to carry out a particular action? Was their data lost? Was their data compromised? How did that affect their lives or jobs?</li>
<li>👩‍💼 <strong>Business</strong>: a helpful way to think about this one is to try to answer the question, how much money did the company lose with this incident?</li>
<li>⚽ <strong>Team</strong>: did someone wake up in the middle of the night to respond? Did people work late? Was the sprint interrupted because many team members had to work on remediation?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-detection">🚨 Detection</h3>
<p>How did the team become aware of the issue? At best, an alert told you something was wrong even before users became aware. At worst, a user had to submit a ticket to Product Support.</p>
<h3 id="-triage">🔍 Triage</h3>
<p>What were the actions taken by the responder to assess the severity of the issue and escalate?</p>
<h3 id="-root-causes">🐛 Root causes</h3>
<p>Share the team&rsquo;s steps to investigate the issue and identify the root cause. Include information gathered from observability tools like screenshots or links to dashboards. Do not spare details here. Everyone can learn a lot about how the system works from this section.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/">blameless postmortems</a>, although I am conscious of how easy it is to avoid attribution. Focus on the circumstances that triggered the incident instead of the individuals. But be careful not to skip the root cause entirely.</p>
<h3 id="-resolution">🧯 Resolution</h3>
<p>What actions did the team take to bring the system back to normal? How did you make sure everything was, indeed, okay?</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t forget the charts!</p>
<h3 id="-timeline">⏱️ Timeline</h3>
<p>Share the complete list of events. Compiling the actual timeline is much easier when the incident leader takes notes during the incident.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp.</li>
<li>Action or discovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-lessons-learned">👩‍🎓 Lessons learned</h3>
<p>Knowing what happened, it&rsquo;s time to reflect. I like to focus on three categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>👍 What went well</li>
<li>👎 What went wrong</li>
<li>🤞 Where we got lucky</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it in terms of software and processes and avoid attributing individual blame.</p>
<h3 id="-actions-and-issues">⏭️ Actions and issues</h3>
<p>List of remediation and preemptive actions. Ideally, all of them have a corresponding ticket. Focus on process improvements and technical work to address what went wrong and avoid depending on luck. As an engineering leader, it&rsquo;s your job to work with Product Management and prioritize those tickets.</p>
<h3 id="-share-it">👐 Share it</h3>
<p>Always share the document with the entire organization. In some cases, consider sharing an adapted version with customers. It may feel scary and shameful. However, being open about mistakes and your actions to improve is a great way to protect the trust you worked so hard to build.</p>
<p>🙌 Thanks for reading. Hopefully, this template can help you make the most of the situation when your system blows up. I would love to hear from you if you&rsquo;re approaching things differently.</p>

  <img src="./img/understand-the-why.webp" alt="team building a wooden house">

</p>
<p>Every engineer in the team must understand the <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Can everyone confidently answer the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What problem are we trying to solve with this user story?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the <em>why</em> is essential to the success of a project and the team&rsquo;s performance. A group of people who don&rsquo;t understand users or their problems cannot build a high-quality product.</p>
<p>Sure, you have well-specified epics and user stories. Still, during delivery, the team will have to make dozens of decisions that are not detailed in the ticket. There are two options. Either delivery grinds to a halt, with engineers constantly asking the Designer/PM. Or they make the decisions themselves. To make the right decisions, everyone needs to understand users, the problem, and the solution.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to understand the <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Many organizations struggle with this. Engineers focus on closing the next ticket in time for sprint review, and PMs are frustrated when features suffer delays because they were subpar.</p>
<p>As an engineering leader, the bad news is that you are responsible for the situation. The good news is that you can turn the ship around.</p>
<h3 id="-dog-food-the-product">🐶 Dog-food the product</h3>
<p>What easier way to understand the product better than to use it every day?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; None.</p>
<p>Admittedly, some organizations have it easier than others. Engineers at <a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a> use their own product to observe Honeycomb. If your product doesn&rsquo;t lend itself naturally to be used by engineers, there are still things you can do.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.plot.co/">Plot</a>, we build a tool to help you create learning experiences like the world&rsquo;s best learning designer. We&rsquo;re running a challenge where we will all design a course using our tool. Not only will everyone familiarize themselves with the experience of using the product, but we will also collect loads of valuable feedback.</p>
<h3 id="-engineers-join-ux-interviews">🧪 Engineers join UX interviews</h3>
<p>Engineers who talk to users are bound to get to know them better. They can read written feedback, but there&rsquo;s nothing like talking to them face to face.</p>
<p>You can suggest they join your team&rsquo;s Designer on the next series of user interviews that validate the solution they will work on next. Start with Engineers shadowing, so they become comfortable. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll get a few individuals interested in conducting interviews themselves!</p>
<h3 id="-the-team-refines-together">👌 The team refines together</h3>
<p>Many teams do not refine user stories together. I am shocked at the number of instances when just the Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and Designer discuss the backlog. The Engineering Manager breaks down stories into tasks and assigns them to individuals in the team.</p>
<p>I cannot state how extremely damaging that is.</p>
<p>Firstly, Engineers only receive a piece of the puzzle, making it impossible to see the bigger picture. Secondly, they never get the chance to break stories into smaller chunks, missing out on developing a crucial skill.</p>
<p>Refining together is a great way to share knowledge about the system, where the pitfalls and the opportunities are.</p>
<h3 id="-design-sprints--ideation-sessions">👨‍🎨 Design sprints &amp; ideation sessions</h3>
<p>Having Engineers and other roles participate in design sprints or ideation sessions before a solution is presented to them is fantastic. Instead of thinking about the solution at hand, everyone is now thinking about the actual problem or frictions users face.</p>
<p>There are a couple of bonuses. One is that Engineers feel more ownership over what they build. The other one is that Engineers might identify great solutions a Designer or PM thought to be technically infeasible. Yet another classic example of why diverse teams build better products.</p>
<h3 id="-everyone-does-support">💬 Everyone does support!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s typical of early-stage startups for everyone to help out with the help desk rotation. The Product Support team may not even exist yet! However, this normally stops the second the Support team assembles.</p>
<p>A day where the Product Development team helps with Product Support will be a true eye-opener. There is nothing like seeing raw user frustration first-hand. It puts the roadmap into perspective.</p>
<h3 id="-make-product-part-of-the-jd-and-interview-process">👩‍💻 Make Product part of the JD and interview process</h3>
<p>If your interview process focuses exclusively on technical knowledge, you may attract Engineers who are not interested in understanding users.</p>
<p>Think about the questions and conversations you may have to understand better how candidates think about user problems and solutions.</p>
<h3 id="-make-time-for-it">⏳ Make time for it</h3>
<p>Of course, you cannot just add new responsibilities to your team and expect nothing else to change. It&rsquo;s an investment. The team may move slightly more slowly initially to increase quality and velocity later.</p>
<p>🙌 Do you have other practices or techniques? Please do let me know!</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of a heated tech job market. <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-for-tech-workers-to-navigate-a-heated-job-market/">The most heated tech job market in history</a>!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last. I know that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/13/analyzing-the-software-engineer-shortage/?sh=8c36ed0321c6">it&rsquo;s a great time to be an engineer</a> right now. Yet, many people seem to forget a job interview goes both ways. Too many great developers make it through the interview process, asking superficial questions. Reality slaps them in the face when they start in their new role.</p>
<p>Awful team dynamics, managers excluding valuable team members, ego contests, lack of feedback, no proper coaching, etc. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Has this ever happened to you? Read on!</p>
<p>I recognize that not everyone can afford to be picky when looking for a job. It is a privilege. You may even fear coming across as fussy or difficult to work with. However, good interviewers should see real and profound questions as positive. You show that you have clear values and a vision for the kind of organization you want to be a part of. As an experienced interviewer, I promise that you will be better off.</p>
<p>What questions should you be asking though?</p>
<p>Of course, you may want to learn all about the technology stack and their agile practices. Get those questions out of the way ASAP. Ideally, the team should have those <a href="https://dev.to/aulaeducation/aula-behind-the-scenes-of-the-learning-experience-platform-our-stack-1gno">publicly documented somewhere</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go over eight questions you can ask your potential engineering manager. They will help you answer whether you want to work there.</p>
<h3 id="1--what-are-the-expectations-of-the-role-what-would-you-expect-from-me-in-30-days-and-in-3-months">1. 🏆 What are the expectations of the role? What would you expect from me in 30 days? And in 3 months?</h3>
<p>Some managers do not set clear expectations. Awful! Their reports are often surprised during performance reviews. If they can share an actual expectations doc, that would be perfect.</p>
<p>Actual expectations shape culture. That is what the people you may work with will optimize for.</p>
<p>Asking about different timeframes will help you understand the onboarding experience and timeframes.</p>
<h3 id="2--what-is-the-teams-biggest-challenge">2. 🏔️ What is the team&rsquo;s biggest challenge?</h3>
<p>Does the answer feel like an exciting problem for you to solve? Or is it more like a glimpse into a world of chaos that makes you want to run away and never look back?</p>
<h3 id="3--how-are-technical-decisions-made">3. 🤔 How are technical decisions made?</h3>
<p>Are technical decisions exclusively made by a little boys club no one can join? I have been on the receiving end of that, and it is frustrating as hell. You want to look for a team where individuals of all levels make proposals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">RFC</a>/<a href="https://adr.github.io/">ADR</a> format works well. This is because <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/12/10/the-art-of-asynchronous-optimizing-efficiency-in-remote-teams/?sh=42bfa18a747c">async communication acts as a leveler</a>.</p>
<h3 id="4--how-are-product-decisions-made-what-role-do-engineers-play">4. 🧪 How are product decisions made? What role do engineers play?</h3>
<p>Are engineers treated like code monkeys, key pushers, or mere resources? In too many places, it&rsquo;s the Engineering Manager, the only one who talks to the Product Manager.</p>
<p>Are you passionate about the products you build? Then you want to make sure engineers join ideation sessions and even user interviews.</p>
<h3 id="5--what-does-career-progression-look-like">5. 🧗‍♀️ What does career progression look like?</h3>
<p>When you talk about expectations, it&rsquo;s a great time to ask about career progression. Are great engineers forced into management as the only option available?</p>
<p>As long as they document expectations, you should be able to check out those for the level above the one you applied for.</p>
<h3 id="6--how-do-you-run-your-1-1s-what-is-your-coaching-style">6. 🤝 How do you run your 1-1s? What is your coaching style?</h3>
<p>Many managers run them as status updates with little to no structure. Instead, 1-1 time should be <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/coaching-and-feedback/running-one-on-ones">structured and belong to you</a>. They are a place for you to give and receive feedback, build a trusting relationship, and discuss growth.</p>
<h3 id="7--whats-your-strategy-to-break-down-silos-and-avoid-a-small-bus-factor">7. 🚌 What&rsquo;s your strategy to break down silos and avoid a small bus factor?</h3>
<p>Teams where people work in their little corner, will hamper your development. They also tend to descend into chaos when the person who does X is on holiday or ill. Presumably, you want to be part of a team where sharing knowledge is rewarded.</p>
<p>The team may work in cross-functional groups, pair, organize tech talks or run guilds.</p>
<h3 id="8--think-of-the-last-couple-of-engineers-who-left-what-were-their-reasons">8. 🚪 Think of the last couple of engineers who left. What were their reasons?</h3>
<p>The reasons may be complex as people usually are. Now is the moment to try and sense whether you are about to step into a drama fest. Most people who leave because it was the natural step in their career do so in friendly ways.</p>
