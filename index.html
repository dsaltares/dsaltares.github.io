      <p>Since the original 1968 article, there has been a lot of debate around the figure of the 10x developer. We’re talking about engineers who are an order of magnitude better than their peers by whatever measure.

      A few weeks ago, Jay Cano and I took part in the week-long Godot Wild Jam 18 and submitted Plague. Here are some of my personal thoughts on how we did and maybe some lessons for the future!
📈 Results Out of 43 submissions, we ranked 6th overall. That is the top 13th percentile. More importantly, we ranked 3th for fun or top 6th percentile. For the sake of comparison, Onederful Wizard, which we submitted to the GMTK 2019, ranked 294 out of 2617 entries (top 11th percentile).

      My friend Jay and I recently took part in Godot Wild Jam, a week long game jam where entries must be made using Godot Engine.
We had an absolute blast! The result is Plague, a procedurally generated action platformer. You can play it in the browser and use either a gamepad or keyboard!

      This weekend FOSDEM 2020 will take place in Brussels. FOSDEM is a yearly conference about open source software. It&rsquo;s totally free and no registration is required. As a consequence, it&rsquo;s massive and chaotic, but also a lot of fun! I attended in 2017 and loved it, so I really look forward to this year&rsquo;s edition.
If this is your first time, here&rsquo;s a few tips that may come in handy.

      I had been using a DigitalOcean droplet to host this blog and personal projects for years. But&hellip; Do I really need to spend the $6/month? It&rsquo;s just a static Hugo site, which Github pages can do for free. Game hosting on itch.io is also free, it even gives you a mechanism to embed your web games. Looks like I&rsquo;d be sorted!
Here&rsquo;s a simple CD workflow for deploying a Huge site to Github pages.

      Automated testing in gamedev Nowadays, most people agree that automated testing is absolutely crucial for all software development. Not so much when it comes to games development though. I still believe that the games industry would be able to iterate and ship faster by introducing unit and integration testing in the right places.
Godot and Gut Butch Wesley appears to be onboard, considering he created Gut, an automated testing framework for the Godot Game Engine.

      PyCon ES 2017 was an absolute blast!
The talks were very interesting and they&rsquo;re all freely available on their Youtube channel.
Celebrating PyCon ES 2017 in Caceres, located in southern Spain, was a great choice. Beautiful medieval city center where some scenes in Game of Thrones were filmed, plus cheap and delicious food.

      PyCon ES 2017, which will be running from September 22nd to September 24th in Cáceres, Spain. I&rsquo;ll be attending alongside some Bloomberg colleagues as we are one of the main sponsors of the event. If you have tickets, definitely come say hi!
I&rsquo;ll be helping out at a couple of presentations:
 Bloomberg - Landing on a top Tech Tier Company Load test your backend with locust.io  For those not coming, I&rsquo;m pretty sure all the talks will be recorded and made publicly available.

      JSConf EU is one of the biggest JS conferences in Europe and I was lucky enough to attend its 2017 edition earlier this month. This year the event took place in Arena Berlin, a place by the river, typically dedicated to concerts in the east side of the German capital.
Overall, it was a pretty awesome weekend and although I wish there were more talks on advanced technical topics, I understand the event is more focused on community and diversity.

      Ludum Dare 38 starts in a couple of hours. This one is special as it marks the 15th anniversary of the biggest weekend game development friendly competition in the world!
If you don&rsquo;t know about Ludum Dare and are interested, check the documentary they just released.
I was thinking of participating using Godot Engine. I have a couple of social compromises this weekend and, honestly, I am a bit scared of failing miserably, so I&rsquo;m not too sure how far I&rsquo;ll take this one.

      Two weekends ago I attended FOSDEM in Brussels for the first time and it was awesome. FOSDEM is a free conference about software development and open source with no registration required. Just show up, meet the community and learn new things.
Here are my highlights.
Planning With over 8k developers, 600 talks and 50 tracks spread across the university campus, planning is essential. Popular talks would fill up the rooms very early and the best option was to attend the previous one and get a spot in advance.

      Godot Engine caught my eye a while back as a serious open source alternative to the ubiquitous Unity. Some of you may know I&rsquo;ve been involved with the Libgdx project for some time, I even wrote a book about it!
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Libgdx, I absolutely love the project and the more than welcoming community around it.
The problem is that shipping a game is hard. Doing so whilst working a full time job is harder.
