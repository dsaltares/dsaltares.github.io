      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">May 4, 2021 &middot; 3 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/6-tips-to-make-remote-meetings-more-inclusive/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="./categories/leadership">Leadership</a>
      </span>
      
      <p><img src="./img/remote-work.webp" alt="remote work"></p>
<p>So much goes into fostering an inclusive remote culture. It must be done deliberately, like <a href="https://www.runekvist.com/remote-first">tending to a greenhouse</a>.</p>
<p>As an Engineering leader, I am committed to creating a safe environment in my team where everyone feels included.</p>
<p>One aspect of remote work, where lack of inclusion can really alienate your team, is meetings. So here are 6 tips on how to make them a bit more inclusive.</p>
<h3 id="1--default-to-async">1. ✍️ Default to async</h3>
<p>Async communication acts as a leveller. It&rsquo;s no longer about who talks first or loudest. When someone lays out a great proposal in writing, seniority starts to matter less.</p>
<p>Do you really need a meeting? Consider an async discussion on a Google doc, Notion page or Github RFC issue.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/aulaeducation/How-we-work-together-2501716c17a64fae849b74e800b3f83d#1afa3cd0dafc4f3e986350c3e1e5837a">Aula</a>, <a href="https://about.gitlab.com/company/culture/all-remote/asynchronous/#remind-people-that-async-is-more-inclusive">Gitlab</a> and many other remote-first companies already encourage this.</p>
<h3 id="2--respect-peoples-calendars">2. 📆 Respect people&rsquo;s calendars</h3>
<p>When setting up a meeting, check the attendees' calendar first and do not create the event if there is a clash, at least without asking first.</p>
<p>At Aula, we encourage everyone to be explicit and use Google Calendar as a communication tool by explicitly setting time for things like:</p>
<ul>
<li>🕰️ Working hours</li>
<li>🥘 Lunch time</li>
<li>🏫 School run</li>
<li>🤸‍♂️ Workout</li>
<li>❌ &hellip; Any unavailable time.</li>
</ul>
<p>Respecting people&rsquo;s calendars is respecting their time and making them feel included. You&rsquo;re basically saying that it doesn&rsquo;t matter that they care for a dependent relative or live in a different timezone. They are an important part of the session.</p>
<p>If making calendars work is hell 🔥, default to async!</p>
<h3 id="3--send-agenda-well-in-advance">3. 📝 Send agenda well in advance</h3>
<p>Not only <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/working-as-a-team/running-meetings">will your meetings be much more productive</a>, they will also allow more introverted folks, like myself, to prepare and participate more. We will thank you!</p>
<p>A meeting invite without an agenda can be extremely anxiety inducing. During those meetings, it&rsquo;s usually the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hartman_Personality_Profile#Reds_core_motive">red</a> people who dominate the conversation. When that happens, you may be missing out on extremely valuable points of view.</p>
<h3 id="4--observe-and-pick-up-on-cues">4. 👀 Observe and pick up on cues</h3>
<p>Picking up on certain dynamics during a remote video call can be more challenging than in person although it is just as important.</p>
<p>💬 Is someone dominating the conversation? Interject and give space for other voices. If it keeps happening, give them candid feedback 1-1.</p>
<p>🙋‍♀️ Did someone unmute and then muted on the video call? Maybe they wanted to participate but did not get the chance. Politely ask if they wanted to say something. Lots of video tools have a &ldquo;raise hand&rdquo; feature these days. Pay attention to raised hands.</p>
<p>🤐 Did someone not participate at all? You could ask if they want to add something. However, be mindful as not everyone may want to be put on the spot. The best is to check with them 1-1 whether that&rsquo;s something they would appreciate.</p>
<h3 id="5--rotate-moderators">5. 👑 Rotate moderators</h3>
<p>Depending on the scope of the meeting, it may be beneficial to rotate the moderator and let members of your team own the session.</p>
<p>Decisions made during these meetings will automatically get more <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/working-as-a-team/decision-making#getting-buy-in">buy-in</a> and your team will develop.</p>
<h3 id="6--lead-by-asking-the-silly-questions">6. ✋ Lead by asking the <em>&ldquo;silly questions&rdquo;</em></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s easy to try encourage your team by saying &ldquo;there are no silly questions&rdquo;. Sure, this is nice but folks can still be intimidated and may dread judgement from their peers.</p>
<p>We can do better.</p>
<p>Lead by example and <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23500254-the-power-of-vulnerability">be vulnerable</a> by sharing what you don&rsquo;t know or are unsure about. <a href="https://ideas.ted.com/how-showing-vulnerability-helps-build-a-stronger-team/">Vulnerability builds trust</a>.</p>
<h3 id="-thanks">🙌 Thanks</h3>
<p>You made it!</p>

      <p>Back in 2020, I migrated this blog to <a href="https://saltares.com/easily-deploy-your-hugo-site-to-github-pages/">Hugo and Github pages</a>. I also set up a <em>&ldquo;push to publish&rdquo;</em> CD pipeline with Github pages.</p>
<p>Happy days.</p>
<p>🤔 A couple of days ago I wondered if there was a low effort way to schedule posts. That way, I could easily bulk some writing together and publish it later on without having to come back to it.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s actually trivial to set up!</p>
<p>Simply add a <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events">schedule trigger</a> to your Github Action like so:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4"><code class="language-yaml" data-lang="yaml"><span style="color:#f92672">name</span>: <span style="color:#ae81ff">Build and deploy</span>

</code></pre></div><p>Now you can push posts that will be published into the future by setting the <a href="https://gohugo.io/content-management/front-matter/">front matter</a> <code>date</code>.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>date: 3059-05-01T00:00:00+00:00
</code></pre><p>That could be a post for future generations 😅.</p>
<p>When <code>hugo</code> runs, it does not generate HTML for posts with dates in the future. However, our Github Action runs every day at midnight. This means that the run for May 1st 3059 will actually generate the HTML for our scheduled post and publish it 🙌.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Apr 26, 2021 &middot; 6 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/how-to-hire-8-engineers-in-8-weeks/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="./categories/leadership">Leadership</a>
      </span>
      
      <p>Hiring engineers is top of mind for any engineering leader, this year at Aula it is the same for me. As VP Engineering I have the daunting task of tripling the size of our Engineering team. Happy to say we are well on track, in the last 8 weeks we have successfully hired 8 wonderful engineers and more than doubled our size!</p>
<p>I wrote this post for other engineering leaders who’ve just been given the opportunity to rapidly grow their organisations.</p>
<p>Where does one even start?</p>
<h2 id="-context">💜 Context</h2>
<p>At <a href="https://www.aula.education/">Aula</a>, we’re building the Learning Experience Platform for higher education.</p>
<p>Aula took the decision to grow its Engineering and Product organisation at the beginning of 2021. We’re building the features that will make educators fall in love with our platform and enable them to create engaging learning experiences for their students.</p>
<p>Check out our <a href="https://portal.aula.education/tabs/9-vision">platform vision</a> to learn more about what we are building.</p>
<p>Not only do we want to grow fast but we want to ensure that we are focusing on building a high performing, diverse and inclusive team.</p>
<p>We thought as many engineering leaders are facing the same challenges we should share what we have learned along the way to help you do it too. And of course, if you want to come and join us in this adventure, <a href="https://aulaeducation.recruitee.com/">we are still hiring</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-prioritise-hiring">🔝 Prioritise hiring</h2>
<p>Giving my team the capacity to achieve our goals was the best way I could help, so I made hiring my number 1 priority.</p>
<p>Not having a huge Recruitment team meant I had to get stuck into the process of recruitment myself.</p>
<p>Look at your calendar, if at least 50% of your time is not spent on hiring related activities, hiring is not your top priority and you need to fix it. Prioritising hiring will mean saying no to other things.</p>
<p>My recommendation here is to roll up your sleeves and jump into your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Applicant_tracking_system">ATS</a>. Being hands on in recruitment will help you understand the candidates attracted to your organisation, refine the recruiting process and ensure that everything is kept moving forward. I spend 30 minutes every morning checking CV’s, looking at interview feedback and ensuring that I know exactly what is happening in my recruitment pipeline.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.notion.so/aulaeducation/Mission-and-Virtues-at-Aula-9f2c356b2d8e44f9bfdb772ec3ca396c">Uncomfortably focused</a> is one of our virtues here at Aula. I know that the team has suffered in the short term because I haven’t been able to spend as much time as I would have liked supporting them. However in the long run, bringing in new team members to support what we are building has led to everyone being happier.</p>
<h2 id="-get-ready-to-talk-to-a-lot-of-people">💬 Get ready to talk to a lot of people</h2>
<p>Recruiting is a people game, doing this successfully means you&rsquo;re about to meet a lot of new people.</p>
<p>One of the most important things is to make the time to do that. If you want your business to start growing, then this is the first thing you should do is make sure you are ok with the idea that hiring starts with conversations.</p>
<p>In the first quarter of 2021, we had more than 1100 people enter the top of our recruiting funnel and spoke with more than 200 engineers who could potentially fit the job.</p>
<p>I send messages on LinkedIn, emails to potential candidates and ask friends in my network for help.</p>
<p>This can be tremendously draining for an introvert such as myself. Well, it may be draining for just about anyone! Make sure to take breaks and rest well.</p>
<h2 id="-standardise-the-process">♻️ Standardise the process</h2>
<p>Standardising your hiring process is one of the most high leverage things you can do.</p>
<p>Create wiki pages where you list the questions and problems for each stage of the process. Detail what the team wants to learn from the candidate with each question and what a poor/ok/great answer could look like. Create scorecards for each stage every interviewer will fill in.</p>
<p>Ask every candidate the exact same questions.</p>
<p>This will benefit you in at least three ways:</p>
<p>⚖️ Consistency allows you to get better insights, compare and evaluate candidates much more easily.
📚 A documented process will help team members with little interviewer experience get trained.
🤔 Standardised interviews will reduce the biases of the process. To minimise bias, you should also have two interviewers at each stage.</p>
<h2 id="-build-great-relationships-with-your-recruiters">🤝 Build great relationships with your recruiters</h2>
<p>There is no way you will double the size of your team alone. Having a top notch recruitment team is essential.</p>
<p>Make sure your whole team understands the profile you’re looking for and why they would join your company. The recruiters you are working with are an extension of your voice in the market and will be pitching candidates.</p>
<p>We do engineering hiring standups 3 times a week, run retrospectives every month, constantly give each other feedback and document everything.</p>
<h2 id="-build-great-content">✍️ Build great content</h2>
<p>In order for your jobs to stand out, you need to tell a story. From the job ad to all your interactions with candidates through the process. You will have to raise awareness about what you’re all about and tell this story a thousand times.</p>
<p>The best way is to write it or film it and put it out there!</p>
<p>At Aula, we have built great pieces of content that continue to help us through this journey:</p>
<ul>
<li>🧠 <a href="https://www.notion.so/aulaeducation/The-Aula-Brain-4da091a8797840108311d99815b3b36f">The Aula Brain</a> - our public handbook.</li>
<li>👩‍💻 <a href="https://dev.to/aulaeducation/aula-behind-the-scenes-of-the-learning-experience-platform-our-stack-1gno">A blog post about our tech stack</a>.</li>
<li>🛣️ <a href="https://portal.aula.education/">Our public roadmap</a>.</li>
<li>💼 <a href="https://www.notion.so/aulaeducation/How-we-work-b1af4d53998949e5b05697158261c27a">How our Product Development team works together</a>.</li>
<li>📽️ <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIXtXYkqqJg&amp;feature=emb_logo">Camila’s story</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Language matters. Make sure you avoid gender bias from your content as much as possible. I recommend you run your content through an analyser such as <a href="http://gender-decoder.katmatfield.com/">Gender Decoder</a>.</p>
<h2 id="-automate-as-much-as-possible">⚙️ Automate as much as possible</h2>
<p>There will be an enormous amount of repetitive work. It’s best to automate as much of it up front.</p>
<p>A lot of our interview scheduling is done through <a href="https://calendly.com/">Calendly</a>. So much email back and forth has been avoided by this!</p>
<p>Every time a candidate is moved through the pipeline, our ATS automatically sends emails and assigns tasks for the next steps. This saves time but also lifts a huge mental burden.</p>
<p>Don’t remove the human element from the process, especially when it comes to giving feedback. Candidates invest valuable time interviewing with you. Anyone who is rejected deserves a customised message with specific feedback.</p>
<h2 id="-pre-book-interview-slots">📆 Pre-book interview slots</h2>
<p>The engineers in your team will have to do a ton of interviews. This takes a lot of time and focus from sprint work. It’s not just the interview slot but the prior prep and evaluation that comes after as well.</p>
<p>Context switching can kill productivity and increase stress.</p>
<p>To help engineers focus, have pre-booked weekly interview slots. Predictability will facilitate better time management.</p>
<h2 id="-track-everything--iterate">🔍 Track everything &amp; iterate</h2>
<p>Use the data to make better decisions and set targets.</p>
<p>Track everything. Measure your data and analyse it to make better decisions that can help you optimise to achieve your goals. Data can help you make changes to attract more applicants, avoid losing candidates or screen better and save engineering interviewer time.</p>
<h2 id="-thats-it">🙌 That’s it!</h2>
<p>Really keen to hear if you think I missed anything important and let me know if you found this useful.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s so much more that could be covered!</p>
<ul>
<li>🏫 Interviewer training</li>
<li>👩‍🎓 Onboarding</li>
<li>🚀 And more!</li>

      <p>✏️ Introducing <a href="https://doodle.saltares.com">Doodle</a>, a crazy drawing &amp; guessing chain game. Think Pictionary meets Telephone. Better played with your friends over a video call!</p>
<p><a href="./img/doodle/gallery/brainstorming.png"><img src="./img/doodle/gallery/brainstorming.png" alt="doodle brainstorming"></a></p>
<p>🏠 Doodle is a little side project I made during covid-19 confinement to play with friends while we cannot meet face to face. Initially, I thought the crisis would end before I finished it, which would make me lose interest. Little did I know! Not only did I finish it, Doodle has already lightened up the mood in a few remote evenings.</p>
<p>💻 The game is entirely written in Typescript, which I had never used before. I&rsquo;ve had lots of fun building it, getting feedback and playing with friends. I hope to soon post a more detailed post-mortem on the whole process. Maybe even a couple of articles about things I learned.</p>
<p>🤓 In the meantime, you can check out the source code on <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/doodle">Github</a>.</p>
<p>🙌 Give it a try and be sure to let me know any thoughts or feedback!</p>

<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/senthe">Jay Cano</a> and I took part in the week-long <a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-18">Godot Wild Jam 18</a> and submitted <a href="https://dsaltares.itch.io/plague">Plague</a>. Here are some of my personal thoughts on how we did and maybe some lessons for the future!</p>
<h2 id="-results">📈 Results</h2>
<p>Out of 43 submissions, we ranked 6th overall. That is the top 13th percentile. More importantly, we ranked 3th for fun or top 6th percentile. For the sake of comparison, <a href="game-jams/onederful-wizzard/">Onederful Wizard</a>, which we submitted to the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019">GMTK 2019</a>, ranked 294 out of 2617 entries (top 11th percentile).</p>
<p>Even though both games received positive feedback, Plague ranked high for fun. We&rsquo;re very happy about that!</p>

<h2 id="-what-went-well">👍 What went well</h2>
<h3 id="-splitting-tasks">✅ Splitting tasks</h3>
<p>During the previous jam, Jay and I rushed to implement features like crazy. Despite, Godot being very source control friendly, we ended up having to manually resolve too many merge conflicts.</p>
<p>This time we were much better organised and split tasks in a more consistent way.</p>
<ul>
<li>👋 David: player movement, enemy behaviour, individual game systems, menus and effects.</li>
<li>👋 Jay: procedural level generation, level section design, enemy/item spawning and putting it all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we both had separate <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/c2a13c5d40c06146a80b24380b4654cdcfcb5198/game/david/david_test.tscn">&ldquo;playground&rdquo; scenes</a> to test our work. We barely faced any merge conflicts!</p>
<h3 id="-platforming">✅ Platforming</h3>
<p>We got pretty good feedback for tight controls. Our <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/master/game/Player/Move.gd">player movement</a> is not too complex. For maximum control, we use a <code>KinematicBody</code> rather than a <code>RigidBody</code>. We did a direct implementation of the formulas explained in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9SzQxaCm8">Building a Better Jump GDC talk</a>.</p>
<div
  style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <iframe
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hG9SzQxaCm8"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen

  </iframe>
</div>

<p>The proposal of the video is simple. The variables designers tweak to control character movement should not be <code>gravity</code>, <code>acceleration</code>, etc. They should be <code>jump_height</code>, <code>jump_distance</code>, <code>time_to_jump_peak</code>, <code>time_to_max_speed</code>, etc. It&rsquo;s much easier to reason about the distance a player can jump to build a level than the combination of gravity and other physics variables.</p>
<p>Additionally, we implemented a very simple <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/5da19b57e42014a3a9f26b64c782a51b5925a39c/game/Player/Air.gd#L33">Coyote Time</a>. This gives players a grace period to jump even if the character has left a platform. Tiny thing, but it makes the experience a lot more responsive.</p>
<h3 id="-procedural-level-generation">✅ Procedural level generation</h3>
<p>The game is a procedurally-generated infinite side-scroller. However, we do not procedurally place tiles. We have 8 hand crafted chunks. Then, the <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/5da19b57e42014a3a9f26b64c782a51b5925a39c/game/Levels/InfiniteLevelManager.gd"><code>InfiniteLevelManager</code></a> script is responsible for randomly selecting the next chunk as the player approaches the end of the current chunk. Finally, it populates the chunk with enemies and ammo pickups.</p>
<p><a href="./img/plague/levelchunk.png"><img src="./img/plague/levelchunk.png" alt="level chunk"></a></p>
<p>This gave us an infinite scroller with a very simple procedural generation algorithm and super tight control over the end result. We even managed to progressively increase difficulty by spawning more and tougher enemies.</p>
<p>With more time, we would have increased the variation and potentially procedurally place decoration on top of the blocks instead of having it built-in.</p>
<h3 id="-re-using-assets">✅ Re-using assets</h3>
<p>Jay and I are both engineers and not very good at art. It was a wise decision to leverage multiple asset packs. This led to good feedback on both audio and visuals.</p>

</ul>
<p>There are so many super high quality free assets, it&rsquo;s insane. If your jam allows it and you have a similar skillset to ours, go for it!</p>
<h3 id="-time-for-polish">✅ Time for polish</h3>
<p>We dedicated a big chunk of the last day for polish and juiciness, which massively increased the game&rsquo;s perceived quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>🎥 Camera shake for damage and bullet impacts.</li>
<li>🦘 Coyote time for jumps.</li>
<li>🎮 Gamepad controls. The game detects Xbox/PS4 controller or keyboard and shows different instructions in the main menu.</li>
<li>⛈️ Weather effects. We added rain, lightning and thunder that start at random intervals.</li>
<li>🌟 Particles and SFX for everything that happens in the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-automatic-deployment">✅ Automatic deployment</h3>
<p>Right before the jam, I implemented a <a href="./continuous-delivery-pipeline-for-godot-and-itch.io/">Continuous Delivery pipeline</a> that exports the game and publishes to itch.io on every push to <code>master</code>. This completely removed the panic that typically happens when something goes wrong with game export right before the deadline.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/releases">go back in time</a> and see how the game looked at any point in time during development.</p>
<h2 id="-what-went-wrong">👎 What went wrong</h2>
<h3 id="-poor-use-of-theme">❌ Poor use of theme</h3>
<p>Due to some issues with the organisation, the theme announcement was delayed by half a day. Knowing that we weren&rsquo;t going to have much time to work on the game during the week, we started right away without a theme.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we failed to go back to the theme and really incorporate it into the game. In the end, you can interpret that the monsters are the &ldquo;plague&rdquo;. Other games like <a href="https://joel127.itch.io/harvestor-3000">Harvestor-3000</a> and <a href="https://heyyeh.itch.io/ceefax">Ceefax</a> made a much better use of the theme.</p>
<p>By the way, this is not a complaint about the organisation at all. We really appreciate their efforts to keep the jam going!</p>
<h3 id="-lack-of-end-goal">❌ Lack of end goal</h3>
<p>The infinite platformer concept made people feel a lack of purpose. We didn&rsquo;t save top scores, so there was obvious sense of improvement nor progression.</p>
<p>An alternative may have been to introduce a final boss and an end-game after a fixed number of chunks. Lack of time!</p>
<h3 id="-yet-another-platformer">❌ Yet another platformer</h3>
<p>The game is a simple platformer and the procedural generation was not enough to make it fresh. That is why we scored the lowest in originality, ranking 28th or 65th percentile.</p>
<p>In future jams, we should prioritize a differentiating feature and really go with it. Hopefully, foundational things like getting movement right will take less time going forward.</p>
<h2 id="-thanks">✌️ Thanks!</h2>
<p>I had a blast participating in the jam. Thank you for reading this postmortem and thanks to everyone who played the game and gave us feedback.</p>
