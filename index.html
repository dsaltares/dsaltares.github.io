      A few weeks ago, Jay Cano and I took part in the week-long Godot Wild Jam 18 and submitted Plague. Here are some of my personal thoughts on how we did and maybe some lessons for the future!
📈 Results Out of 43 submissions, we ranked 6th overall. That is the top 13th percentile. More importantly, we ranked 3th for fun or top 6th percentile. For the sake of comparison, Onederful Wizard, which we submitted to the GMTK 2019, ranked 294 out of 2617 entries (top 11th percentile).

      My friend Jay and I recently took part in Godot Wild Jam, a week long game jam where entries must be made using Godot Engine.
We had an absolute blast! The result is Plague, a procedurally generated action platformer. You can play it in the browser and use either a gamepad or keyboard!
.Get "linkText" Don&rsquo;t congratulate us on the visuals just yet, we used the Rogue Noir asset pack.

      This weekend FOSDEM 2020 will take place in Brussels. FOSDEM is a yearly conference about open source software. It&rsquo;s totally free and no registration is required. As a consequence, it&rsquo;s massive and chaotic, but also a lot of fun! I attended in 2017 and loved it, so I really look forward to this year&rsquo;s edition.
If this is your first time, here&rsquo;s a few tips that may come in handy.
