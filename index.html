</p>
<p>Software incidents suck big time. Suddenly, you have more work to do; the sprint is derailed; stakeholders raise their eyebrows and start asking questions. Nobody wants that! Unfortunately, incidents do happen. Complex software systems are bound to fail from time to time.</p>
<p>An incident can also be an opportunity. Your job is to make sure to seize it. <strong>Incident review docs</strong> followed by a discussion help a lot. Above all else, the main goal of incident reviews is to <strong>learn</strong>, although great incident reviews can achieve much more.</p>
<ul>
<li>Identify ways to make the system more robust.</li>
<li>Identify and close process gaps.</li>
<li>Learn about the system they maintain and develop.</li>
<li>Protect the trust with the rest of the company and customers by being transparent.</li>
<li>Understand user impact better and develop user empathy.</li>
<li>Help future team members understand the systems&rsquo; weak points and how incidents are handled.</li>
</ul>
<p>I recommend the following approach, which <a href="./6-tips-to-make-remote-meetings-more-inclusive/">makes the process more inclusive</a>.</p>
<ol>
<li>The incident leader/responder writes the review doc.</li>
<li>The team reads and comments async.</li>
<li>Everyone gets together to reflect and align on actions.</li>
</ol>
<p>Here&rsquo;s an incident review doc template that has worked well in my teams.</p>
<h3 id="-authors">✍️ Authors</h3>
<p>List the people who put the incident review document together. It will help future readers know who to ask for more information.</p>
<h3 id="-summary">🗞️ Summary</h3>
<p>Write out the TLDR version of what happened.</p>
<h3 id="-impact">🔥 Impact</h3>
<p>When talking about impact, you should consider several dimensions.</p>
<ul>
<li>🚶‍♂️ <strong>User</strong>: were users unable to carry out a particular action? Was their data lost? Was their data compromised? How did that affect their lives or jobs?</li>
<li>👩‍💼 <strong>Business</strong>: a helpful way to think about this one is to try to answer the question, how much money did the company lose with this incident?</li>
<li>⚽ <strong>Team</strong>: did someone wake up in the middle of the night to respond? Did people work late? Was the sprint interrupted because many team members had to work on remediation?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-detection">🚨 Detection</h3>
<p>How did the team become aware of the issue? At best, an alert told you something was wrong even before users became aware. At worst, a user had to submit a ticket to Product Support.</p>
<h3 id="-triage">🔍 Triage</h3>
<p>What were the actions taken by the responder to assess the severity of the issue and escalate?</p>
<h3 id="-root-causes">🐛 Root causes</h3>
<p>Share the team&rsquo;s steps to investigate the issue and identify the root cause. Include information gathered from observability tools like screenshots or links to dashboards. Do not spare details here. Everyone can learn a lot about how the system works from this section.</p>
<p>I am a firm believer in <a href="https://sre.google/sre-book/postmortem-culture/">blameless postmortems</a>, although I am conscious of how easy it is to avoid attribution. Focus on the circumstances that triggered the incident instead of the individuals. But be careful not to skip the root cause entirely.</p>
<h3 id="-resolution">🧯 Resolution</h3>
<p>What actions did the team take to bring the system back to normal? How did you make sure everything was, indeed, okay?</p>
<p>Again, don&rsquo;t forget the charts!</p>
<h3 id="-timeline">⏱️ Timeline</h3>
<p>Share the complete list of events. Compiling the actual timeline is much easier when the incident leader takes notes during the incident.</p>
<ul>
<li>Timestamp.</li>
<li>Action or discovery.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-lessons-learned">👩‍🎓 Lessons learned</h3>
<p>Knowing what happened, it&rsquo;s time to reflect. I like to focus on three categories.</p>
<ul>
<li>👍 What went well</li>
<li>👎 What went wrong</li>
<li>🤞 Where we got lucky</li>
</ul>
<p>Think about it in terms of software and processes and avoid attributing individual blame.</p>
<h3 id="-actions-and-issues">⏭️ Actions and issues</h3>
<p>List of remediation and preemptive actions. Ideally, all of them have a corresponding ticket. Focus on process improvements and technical work to address what went wrong and avoid depending on luck. As an engineering leader, it&rsquo;s your job to work with Product Management and prioritize those tickets.</p>
<h3 id="-share-it">👐 Share it</h3>
<p>Always share the document with the entire organization. In some cases, consider sharing an adapted version with customers. It may feel scary and shameful. However, being open about mistakes and your actions to improve is a great way to protect the trust you worked so hard to build.</p>
<p>🙌 Thanks for reading. Hopefully, this template can help you make the most of the situation when your system blows up. I would love to hear from you if you&rsquo;re approaching things differently.</p>

      <p>
  <img src="./img/understand-the-why.webp" alt="team building a wooden house">

</p>
<p>Every engineer in the team must understand the <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Can everyone confidently answer the question:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What problem are we trying to solve with this user story?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the <em>why</em> is essential to the success of a project and the team&rsquo;s performance. A group of people who don&rsquo;t understand users or their problems cannot build a high-quality product.</p>
<p>Sure, you have well-specified epics and user stories. Still, during delivery, the team will have to make dozens of decisions that are not detailed in the ticket. There are two options. Either delivery grinds to a halt, with engineers constantly asking the Designer/PM. Or they make the decisions themselves. To make the right decisions, everyone needs to understand users, the problem, and the solution.</p>
<p>Everyone needs to understand the <em>why</em>.</p>
<p>Many organizations struggle with this. Engineers focus on closing the next ticket in time for sprint review, and PMs are frustrated when features suffer delays because they were subpar.</p>
<p>As an engineering leader, the bad news is that you are responsible for the situation. The good news is that you can turn the ship around.</p>
<h3 id="-dog-food-the-product">🐶 Dog-food the product</h3>
<p>What easier way to understand the product better than to use it every day?</p>
<p>Well&hellip; None.</p>
<p>Admittedly, some organizations have it easier than others. Engineers at <a href="https://honeycomb.io/">Honeycomb</a> use their own product to observe Honeycomb. If your product doesn&rsquo;t lend itself naturally to be used by engineers, there are still things you can do.</p>
<p>At <a href="https://www.plot.co/">Plot</a>, we build a tool to help you create learning experiences like the world&rsquo;s best learning designer. We&rsquo;re running a challenge where we will all design a course using our tool. Not only will everyone familiarize themselves with the experience of using the product, but we will also collect loads of valuable feedback.</p>
<h3 id="-engineers-join-ux-interviews">🧪 Engineers join UX interviews</h3>
<p>Engineers who talk to users are bound to get to know them better. They can read written feedback, but there&rsquo;s nothing like talking to them face to face.</p>
<p>You can suggest they join your team&rsquo;s Designer on the next series of user interviews that validate the solution they will work on next. Start with Engineers shadowing, so they become comfortable. Perhaps you&rsquo;ll get a few individuals interested in conducting interviews themselves!</p>
<h3 id="-the-team-refines-together">👌 The team refines together</h3>
<p>Many teams do not refine user stories together. I am shocked at the number of instances when just the Engineering Manager, Product Manager, and Designer discuss the backlog. The Engineering Manager breaks down stories into tasks and assigns them to individuals in the team.</p>
<p>I cannot state how extremely damaging that is.</p>
<p>Firstly, Engineers only receive a piece of the puzzle, making it impossible to see the bigger picture. Secondly, they never get the chance to break stories into smaller chunks, missing out on developing a crucial skill.</p>
<p>Refining together is a great way to share knowledge about the system, where the pitfalls and the opportunities are.</p>
<h3 id="-design-sprints--ideation-sessions">👨‍🎨 Design sprints &amp; ideation sessions</h3>
<p>Having Engineers and other roles participate in design sprints or ideation sessions before a solution is presented to them is fantastic. Instead of thinking about the solution at hand, everyone is now thinking about the actual problem or frictions users face.</p>
<p>There are a couple of bonuses. One is that Engineers feel more ownership over what they build. The other one is that Engineers might identify great solutions a Designer or PM thought to be technically infeasible. Yet another classic example of why diverse teams build better products.</p>
<h3 id="-everyone-does-support">💬 Everyone does support!</h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s typical of early-stage startups for everyone to help out with the help desk rotation. The Product Support team may not even exist yet! However, this normally stops the second the Support team assembles.</p>
<p>A day where the Product Development team helps with Product Support will be a true eye-opener. There is nothing like seeing raw user frustration first-hand. It puts the roadmap into perspective.</p>
<h3 id="-make-product-part-of-the-jd-and-interview-process">👩‍💻 Make Product part of the JD and interview process</h3>
<p>If your interview process focuses exclusively on technical knowledge, you may attract Engineers who are not interested in understanding users.</p>
<p>Think about the questions and conversations you may have to understand better how candidates think about user problems and solutions.</p>
<h3 id="-make-time-for-it">⏳ Make time for it</h3>
<p>Of course, you cannot just add new responsibilities to your team and expect nothing else to change. It&rsquo;s an investment. The team may move slightly more slowly initially to increase quality and velocity later.</p>

</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re in the middle of a heated tech job market. <a href="https://blog.pragmaticengineer.com/advice-for-tech-workers-to-navigate-a-heated-job-market/">The most heated tech job market in history</a>!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know how long it will last. I know that <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/forbestechcouncil/2021/04/13/analyzing-the-software-engineer-shortage/?sh=8c36ed0321c6">it&rsquo;s a great time to be an engineer</a> right now. Yet, many people seem to forget a job interview goes both ways. Too many great developers make it through the interview process, asking superficial questions. Reality slaps them in the face when they start in their new role.</p>
<p>Awful team dynamics, managers excluding valuable team members, ego contests, lack of feedback, no proper coaching, etc. The list goes on.</p>
<p>Has this ever happened to you? Read on!</p>
<p>I recognize that not everyone can afford to be picky when looking for a job. It is a privilege. You may even fear coming across as fussy or difficult to work with. However, good interviewers should see real and profound questions as positive. You show that you have clear values and a vision for the kind of organization you want to be a part of. As an experienced interviewer, I promise that you will be better off.</p>
<p>What questions should you be asking though?</p>
<p>Of course, you may want to learn all about the technology stack and their agile practices. Get those questions out of the way ASAP. Ideally, the team should have those <a href="https://dev.to/aulaeducation/aula-behind-the-scenes-of-the-learning-experience-platform-our-stack-1gno">publicly documented somewhere</a>.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go over eight questions you can ask your potential engineering manager. They will help you answer whether you want to work there.</p>
<h3 id="1--what-are-the-expectations-of-the-role-what-would-you-expect-from-me-in-30-days-and-in-3-months">1. 🏆 What are the expectations of the role? What would you expect from me in 30 days? And in 3 months?</h3>
<p>Some managers do not set clear expectations. Awful! Their reports are often surprised during performance reviews. If they can share an actual expectations doc, that would be perfect.</p>
<p>Actual expectations shape culture. That is what the people you may work with will optimize for.</p>
<p>Asking about different timeframes will help you understand the onboarding experience and timeframes.</p>
<h3 id="2--what-is-the-teams-biggest-challenge">2. 🏔️ What is the team&rsquo;s biggest challenge?</h3>
<p>Does the answer feel like an exciting problem for you to solve? Or is it more like a glimpse into a world of chaos that makes you want to run away and never look back?</p>
<h3 id="3--how-are-technical-decisions-made">3. 🤔 How are technical decisions made?</h3>
<p>Are technical decisions exclusively made by a little boys club no one can join? I have been on the receiving end of that, and it is frustrating as hell. You want to look for a team where individuals of all levels make proposals.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Request_for_Comments">RFC</a>/<a href="https://adr.github.io/">ADR</a> format works well. This is because <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/laurelfarrer/2020/12/10/the-art-of-asynchronous-optimizing-efficiency-in-remote-teams/?sh=42bfa18a747c">async communication acts as a leveler</a>.</p>
<h3 id="4--how-are-product-decisions-made-what-role-do-engineers-play">4. 🧪 How are product decisions made? What role do engineers play?</h3>
<p>Are engineers treated like code monkeys, key pushers, or mere resources? In too many places, it&rsquo;s the Engineering Manager, the only one who talks to the Product Manager.</p>
<p>Are you passionate about the products you build? Then you want to make sure engineers join ideation sessions and even user interviews.</p>
<h3 id="5--what-does-career-progression-look-like">5. 🧗‍♀️ What does career progression look like?</h3>
<p>When you talk about expectations, it&rsquo;s a great time to ask about career progression. Are great engineers forced into management as the only option available?</p>
<p>As long as they document expectations, you should be able to check out those for the level above the one you applied for.</p>
<h3 id="6--how-do-you-run-your-1-1s-what-is-your-coaching-style">6. 🤝 How do you run your 1-1s? What is your coaching style?</h3>
<p>Many managers run them as status updates with little to no structure. Instead, 1-1 time should be <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/coaching-and-feedback/running-one-on-ones">structured and belong to you</a>. They are a place for you to give and receive feedback, build a trusting relationship, and discuss growth.</p>
<h3 id="7--whats-your-strategy-to-break-down-silos-and-avoid-a-small-bus-factor">7. 🚌 What&rsquo;s your strategy to break down silos and avoid a small bus factor?</h3>
<p>Teams where people work in their little corner, will hamper your development. They also tend to descend into chaos when the person who does X is on holiday or ill. Presumably, you want to be part of a team where sharing knowledge is rewarded.</p>
<p>The team may work in cross-functional groups, pair, organize tech talks or run guilds.</p>
<h3 id="8--think-of-the-last-couple-of-engineers-who-left-what-were-their-reasons">8. 🚪 Think of the last couple of engineers who left. What were their reasons?</h3>
<p>The reasons may be complex as people usually are. Now is the moment to try and sense whether you are about to step into a drama fest. Most people who leave because it was the natural step in their career do so in friendly ways.</p>
<p>🙌 Want more?</p>
<p>I recently wrote <a href="./the-david-test-an-updated-joel-test-for-2022/">The David test</a>, a list of questions to evaluate engineering teams. You may also find inspiration there.</p>
<p>Did you ever ask a question that provides you with lots of insight about the company you were about to join? Please do share!</p>

      <p>
  <img src="./img/management/girl-fork-road.png" alt="A girl faces a fork in the road">

</p>
<p>Recently, people, who are considering becoming Engineering Managers, have asked about my own experience.</p>
<p>How did I get into it?
How did I know it was what I wanted to do?</p>
<p>The answer may be interesting to others, so I wrote it down.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s take a moment to note that <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/introduction#it-and-x27-s-not-a-promotion-it-and-x27-s-a-career-change">becoming a manager is not a promotion</a>. It&rsquo;s a career change. There&rsquo;s a myriad of <a href="https://charity.wtf/2019/09/08/reasons-not-to-be-a-manager/">reasons not to be a manager</a>. Being a great individual contributor (IC) does not mean you will be a great manager. And, leadership does not equal management.</p>
<p>Additionally, my personal experience may not be similar to that of others. As a white, young, straight man, I have enjoyed loads of privilege throughout my career. Even as an immigrant. People often paid attention to what I had to say and, until recently, I didn&rsquo;t even notice. My career is the result of hard work, (earned) luck, and privilege.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s get into it.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-did-before-becoming-a-manager">What I did before becoming a manager</h3>
<p>
  <img src="./img/management/crytek.png" alt="crytek uk reception">

</p>
<p>My full-time career started at <strong>Crytek UK</strong>, a video games studio, where I spent a couple of years. In the beginning, I was a Junior Developer. Later I was a mid-level one. I spent most of that time at the intersection between character AI and animation. I made the baddies and civilians look natural. The job required me to collaborate with many disciplines. It was quite the list: designers, animators, producers, and gameplay/AI/animation programmers. Later, I took on the role of Scrum Master. That role helped me focus on outcomes over my contributions. This also gave me some stakeholder management skills!</p>
<p>
  <img src="./img/management/sony.png" alt="entrance to Sony Computer Entertainment Europe&amp;rsquo;s offices in London">

</p>
<p>Right after, I spent six months at <strong>Sony</strong> as an R&amp;D Software Engineer. There, I had to manage up to improve our engineering practices and introduce CI. That is also when I started having some difficult conversations related to feedback. Those would prove invaluable later on.</p>
<p>
  <img src="./img/management/bloomberg.png" alt="Bloomberg London Office&amp;rsquo;s central staircase">

</p>
<p>Then, I joined <strong>Bloomberg</strong>, where things kicked off big time. During the first two years, my role was Senior Software Engineer. After that, I took on the Team Lead role, Bloomberg&rsquo;s title for Engineering Manager in other places. In total, I was there for five years.</p>
<p>Here are some of the things I did before becoming a team lead.</p>
<ul>
<li>🕸️ <strong>Owning projects with many dependencies</strong>: ours was an applications team. That meant we depended on many infrastructure teams. Projects usually had a significant coordination overhead.</li>
<li>🏈 <strong>Being a Scrum master</strong>: similarly to what I was doing at Crytek.</li>
<li>👩‍💻 <strong>Mentoring and coaching</strong>: we regularly had interns or new hires joining the team. A few times, I would be their mentor/buddy. This involved running my first 1-1s, setting goals, and giving feedback.</li>
<li>🏫 <strong>Helping with the graduate training class</strong>: Bloomberg ran several graduate cohorts a year. Each ran for 12 weeks. During the workshops, engineers helped the grads with their projects by talking through problems or doing code reviews.</li>
<li>✅ <strong>Being an interviewer</strong>: during my time there, I did hundreds of interviews and hired many engineers. I became more comfortable building rapport with new people and handling difficult situations. It made me think hard about the interview process and its faults. I wanted to be responsible for the process and improve it.</li>
<li>📚 <strong>Taking leadership training</strong>: everyone had to take this course before becoming a manager.</li>
<li>🦸‍♂️ <strong>Having a mentor</strong>: right after I became a people manager, I started working with a mentor. It was invaluable to have someone I could talk to about specific situations and peer review decisions. It helped me to explore and establish my management style and principles.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these opportunities would not have come my way without a supporting manager. At some point, my manager moved to another team. I was offered the role, and I took it.</p>
<h3 id="was-i-sure-i-wanted-to-get-into-management">Was I sure I wanted to get into management?</h3>
<p>Hell no!</p>
<p>I loved the individual contributor (IC) role. Solving technical problems and building a product people enjoyed. Losing that was scary! In the end, two factors made me give it a try:</p>
<ol>
<li>The incredible reward of amplifying the powers of the team. Helping people develop and breaking down some organizational silos felt terrific.</li>
<li>I had seen people make the opposite transition, going from manager back to IC. It could be a <a href="https://www.inc.com/jeff-haden/amazon-founder-jeff-bezos-this-is-how-successful-people-make-such-smart-decisions.html">two-way door decision</a> after all.</li>
</ol>
<p>There&rsquo;s no perfect answer, and you should come up with your own reasons for making the change. Arguably, one could go a long way being an amplifier of their team and helping people develop as an IC!</p>
<p>🙌 Thanks for reading. I hope it was useful!</p>

<p>Stepping into the engineering manager role is challenging. The skills that got you there are not the skills that will make you succeed in your new role. If that wasn&rsquo;t enough, you will feel lonely. The folks who were your peers are now your reports. Those relationships are entirely different now.</p>
<p>You will need plenty of support.</p>
<p>Having a mentor was certainly invaluable, and you should aim to have one. A few selected books gave me tremendously helpful insights. There is a lot of faff on the Internet out there about leadership. So, I thought writing a list may help you find the good ones!</p>
<h2 id="-1-the-managers-handbookhttpsthemanagershandbookcom">🙌 1. <a href="https://themanagershandbook.com/">The Manager&rsquo;s Handbook</a></h2>
<p>Written by <a href="https://alexmaccaw.com/">Alex MacCaw</a> as the actual handbook for managers at Clearbit. It covers a wide range of topics, such as self-awareness, hiring, coaching, expectation setting, and processes with down-to-earth, actionable advice.</p>
<p>The book is quite opinionated, which may not be an entirely bad thing if what you need right now is a bit of structure before you find your management principles and style.</p>
<h2 id="-2-leading-snowflakeshttpsleadingsnowflakescom">❄️ 2. <a href="https://leadingsnowflakes.com/">Leading Snowflakes</a></h2>
<p><a href="https://twitter.com/orenellenbogen">Oren Ellenbogen</a> takes you through the transition from Maker to Manager in this short and to the point guide. Each chapter comes with a bit of &ldquo;homework&rdquo; to put what you learned into practice.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you should subscribe to Oren&rsquo;s newsletter <a href="https://softwareleadweekly.com/">Software Lead Weekly</a>. It is <strong>the</strong> engineering manager newsletter.</p>
<h2 id="-3-radical-candorhttpswwwradicalcandorcomthe-book">🌟 3. <a href="https://www.radicalcandor.com/the-book/">Radical Candor</a></h2>
<p>As an Engineering Manager, you will need to have many challenging conversations. They can be a tremendous emotional drain. You need to let a team member know they are underperforming, but you don&rsquo;t want to be an ass. I get it. Radical Candor by <a href="https://twitter.com/kimballscott">Kim Scott</a> can give you some of the tools to deliver difficult feedback with care and make it easier on your mental health.</p>

<p>A fable by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Lencioni">Patrick Lencioni</a> that tells the story of a newly appointed CEO who finds all sorts of politics and issues within her executive team. This book helped me realise that I no longer had one team, my engineering team. My teammates were now the engineering leadership group.</p>
<h2 id="-5-the-new-one-minute-managerhttpswwwkenblanchardcomstorethe-new-one-minute-manager">🕑 5. <a href="https://www.kenblanchard.com/Store/The-New-One-Minute-Manager">The New One Minute Manager</a></h2>
<p>Another fable, this time by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ken_Blanchard">Ken Blanchard</a>. Perhaps this one is a bit dated, but I remember it dearly as it is one of the first ones I read. It tells the story of a new manager who seeks the knowledge of the legendary One Minute Manager.</p>
<p>🙌 Thanks for reading! Did you notice how only one of these is specific to engineering?</p>
