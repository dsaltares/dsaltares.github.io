      <description>Back in 2020, I migrated this blog to Hugo and Github pages. I also set up a &amp;ldquo;push to publish&amp;rdquo; CD pipeline with Github pages.
Happy days.
ðŸ¤” A couple of days ago I wondered if there was a low effort way to schedule posts. That way, I could easily bulk some writing together and publish it later on without having to come back to it.
It&amp;rsquo;s actually trivial to set up!</description>

      <description>This weekend FOSDEM 2020 will take place in Brussels. FOSDEM is a yearly conference about open source software. It&amp;rsquo;s totally free and no registration is required. As a consequence, it&amp;rsquo;s massive and chaotic, but also a lot of fun! I attended in 2017 and loved it, so I really look forward to this year&amp;rsquo;s edition.
If this is your first time, here&amp;rsquo;s a few tips that may come in handy.</description>

      <title>Easily deploy your Hugo site to Github Pages</title>

      <description>I had been using a DigitalOcean droplet to host this blog and personal projects for years. But&amp;hellip; Do I really need to spend the $6/month? It&amp;rsquo;s just a static Hugo site, which Github pages can do for free. Game hosting on itch.io is also free, it even gives you a mechanism to embed your web games. Looks like I&amp;rsquo;d be sorted!
Here&amp;rsquo;s a simple CD workflow for deploying a Huge site to Github pages.</description>

      <description>PyCon ES 2017 was an absolute blast!
The talks were very interesting and they&amp;rsquo;re all freely available on their Youtube channel.
Celebrating PyCon ES 2017 in Caceres, located in southern Spain, was a great choice. Beautiful medieval city center where some scenes in Game of Thrones were filmed, plus cheap and delicious food.

      <description>PyCon ES 2017, which will be running from September 22nd to September 24th in CÃ¡ceres, Spain. I&amp;rsquo;ll be attending alongside some Bloomberg colleagues as we are one of the main sponsors of the event. If you have tickets, definitely come say hi!
I&amp;rsquo;ll be helping out at a couple of presentations:
Bloomberg - Landing on a top Tech Tier Company Load test your backend with locust.io For those not coming, I&amp;rsquo;m pretty sure all the talks will be recorded and made publicly available.</description>

      <title>JSConf EU 2017 - Recommended talks</title>

      <description>JSConf EU is one of the biggest JS conferences in Europe and I was lucky enough to attend its 2017 edition earlier this month. This year the event took place in Arena Berlin, a place by the river, typically dedicated to concerts in the east side of the German capital.
Overall, it was a pretty awesome weekend and although I wish there were more talks on advanced technical topics, I understand the event is more focused on community and diversity.</description>

      <description>Two weekends ago I attended FOSDEM in Brussels for the first time and it was awesome. FOSDEM is a free conference about software development and open source with no registration required. Just show up, meet the community and learn new things.
Here are my highlights.
Planning With over 8k developers, 600 talks and 50 tracks spread across the university campus, planning is essential. Popular talks would fill up the rooms very early and the best option was to attend the previous one and get a spot in advance.</description>

      <title>Migration from Wordpress to Hugo</title>

      <description>At long last, I got around to do something I had been meaning to do for a very long time. I migrated this Wordpress blog over to a statically generated site powered by Hugo.
That&amp;rsquo;s 6 years or over 300 posts worth of content.
Why not stay with Wordpress? First of all, I wanted to move away from Wordpress because it&amp;rsquo;s heavy and requires quite a bit of setup: PHP, database, plugins and so on.</description>
