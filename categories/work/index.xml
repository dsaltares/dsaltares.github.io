      <description>Hiring engineers is top of mind for any engineering leader, this year at Aula it is the same for me. As VP Engineering I have the daunting task of tripling the size of our Engineering team. Happy to say we are well on track, in the last 8 weeks we have successfully hired 8 wonderful engineers and more than doubled our size!
I wrote this post for other engineering leaders whoâ€™ve just been given the opportunity to rapidly grow their organisations.</description>
