      <description>.Get &#34;linkText&#34;    Onederful Wizard is a puzzle action game where a little wizard goes from room to room defeating monsters with a single fireball.
The theme of the game jam was &amp;ldquo;Only One&amp;rdquo;, so we created a game where you have only one shot to solve all the puzzles and defeat all the enemies. After casting the spell, you will have to go a fetch it again so you can keep going.</description>
