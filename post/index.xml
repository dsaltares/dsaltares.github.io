      <description>By Sarah Kilian on Unsplash  To err is human, and I certainly have made my share of mistakes in my career as an engineering leader. Undoubtedly, I still have quite a few yet to make. Like with software incidents, it is vital to reflect and learn from mistakes, so that our system becomes more robust and we grow as professionals.
Today, I thought it would be interesting to go through 6 mistakes I have made as an engineering leader.</description>

      <title>A playbook for calm incident response</title>

      <description>By Camilo Jimenez on Unsplash  Incident response can be stressful. The system is on fire, the team has to fix it ASAP, and you&amp;rsquo;re working against the clock. Your users are getting frustrated, the company loses money, stakeholders constantly check for updates, and trust is at risk. What a nightmare!
The tension is so high that the incident responder forgets to communicate effectively or is so worried about keeping folks up to date that they take the wrong action, further compromising the system.</description>

      <description>By Sieuwert Otterloo on Unsplash  Software incidents suck big time. Suddenly, you have more work to do; the sprint is derailed; stakeholders raise their eyebrows and start asking questions. Nobody wants that! Unfortunately, incidents do happen. Complex software systems are bound to fail from time to time.
An incident can also be an opportunity. Your job is to make sure to seize it. Incident review docs followed by a discussion help a lot.</description>

      <title>Help Engineers understand the Why</title>

      <description>Every engineer in the team must understand the why.
Can everyone confidently answer the question:
 What problem are we trying to solve with this user story?
 Understanding the why is essential to the success of a project and the team&amp;rsquo;s performance. A group of people who don&amp;rsquo;t understand users or their problems cannot build a high-quality product.
Sure, you have well-specified epics and user stories. Still, during delivery, the team will have to make dozens of decisions that are not detailed in the ticket.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;re in the middle of a heated tech job market. The most heated tech job market in history!
I don&amp;rsquo;t know how long it will last. I know that it&amp;rsquo;s a great time to be an engineer right now. Yet, many people seem to forget a job interview goes both ways. Too many great developers make it through the interview process, asking superficial questions. Reality slaps them in the face when they start in their new role.</description>

      <title>How I got into Engineering management</title>

      <description>Recently, people, who are considering becoming Engineering Managers, have asked about my own experience.
How did I get into it? How did I know it was what I wanted to do?
The answer may be interesting to others, so I wrote it down.
Let&amp;rsquo;s take a moment to note that becoming a manager is not a promotion. It&amp;rsquo;s a career change. There&amp;rsquo;s a myriad of reasons not to be a manager.</description>

      <title>5 books you should read as a new Engineering Manager</title>

      <description>Stepping into the engineering manager role is challenging. The skills that got you there are not the skills that will make you succeed in your new role. If that wasn&amp;rsquo;t enough, you will feel lonely. The folks who were your peers are now your reports. Those relationships are entirely different now.
You will need plenty of support.
Having a mentor was certainly invaluable, and you should aim to have one.</description>

      <title>The David Test - An updated Joel Test for 2022</title>

      <description>The famous Joel Test is a super quick and fun way to evaluate an engineering organisation by answering 12 simple &amp;ldquo;yes or no&amp;rdquo; questions. At the end, you get a score over 12. There is a problem however.
The test is now 22 years old üò±.
Tools and processes to build software have changed a fair bit over the last two decades. What was considered a potential nice to have, may have become an absolute basic.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s already been a while but, back in November last year, I participated in a panel about remote work organised by the Universitat Oberta de Catalunya (UOC). It was fantastic to share thoughts and opinions with other folks that had different backgrounds and experiences.
üìΩÔ∏è You can watch the entire session here although it is in Spanish.

      <title>Sticky nav bar on scroll with React hooks</title>
      <link>https://saltares.com/sticky-nav-bar-on-scroll-with-react-hooks/</link>

      <guid>https://saltares.com/sticky-nav-bar-on-scroll-with-react-hooks/</guid>
      <description>Recently, I built a small React application that had a header, a navigation bar underneath and then the content. After scrolling past the header, the navigation bar was supposed to stay at the top and not scroll away.
Like so.
 Making the navigation bar position: fixed; top 0; was not going to cut it because the header had to come first unless we scrolled past the navigation bar.
I wanted to keep the component that controls the layout as simple as possible, so I abstracted the stickiness logic into a useSticky hook.</description>
