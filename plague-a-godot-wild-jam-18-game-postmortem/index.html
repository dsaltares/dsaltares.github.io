<p>A few weeks ago, <a href="https://twitter.com/senthe">Jay Cano</a> and I took part in the week-long <a href="https://itch.io/jam/godot-wild-jam-18">Godot Wild Jam 18</a> and submitted <a href="https://dsaltares.itch.io/plague">Plague</a>. Here are some of my personal thoughts on how we did and maybe some lessons for the future!</p>
<h2 id="-results">üìà Results</h2>
<p>Out of 43 submissions, we ranked 6th overall. That is the top 13th percentile. More importantly, we ranked 3th for fun or top 6th percentile. For the sake of comparison, <a href="game-jams/onederful-wizzard/">Onederful Wizard</a>, which we submitted to the <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gmtk-2019">GMTK 2019</a>, ranked 294 out of 2617 entries (top 11th percentile).</p>
<p>Even though both games received positive feedback, Plague ranked high for fun. We&rsquo;re very happy about that!</p>

<h2 id="-what-went-well">üëç What went well</h2>
<h3 id="-splitting-tasks">‚úÖ Splitting tasks</h3>
<p>During the previous jam, Jay and I rushed to implement features like crazy. Despite, Godot being very source control friendly, we ended up having to manually resolve too many merge conflicts.</p>
<p>This time we were much better organised and split tasks in a more consistent way.</p>
<ul>
<li>üëã David: player movement, enemy behaviour, individual game systems, menus and effects.</li>
<li>üëã Jay: procedural level generation, level section design, enemy/item spawning and putting it all together.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, we both had separate <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/c2a13c5d40c06146a80b24380b4654cdcfcb5198/game/david/david_test.tscn">&ldquo;playground&rdquo; scenes</a> to test our work. We barely faced any merge conflicts!</p>
<h3 id="-platforming">‚úÖ Platforming</h3>
<p>We got pretty good feedback for tight controls. Our <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/master/game/Player/Move.gd">player movement</a> is not too complex. For maximum control, we use a <code>KinematicBody</code> rather than a <code>RigidBody</code>. We did a direct implementation of the formulas explained in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hG9SzQxaCm8">Building a Better Jump GDC talk</a>.</p>
<div
  style="position: relative; padding-bottom: 62.5%; height: 0; margin-bottom: 1em;">
  <iframe
    style="position: absolute; top: 0; left: 0; width: 100%; height: 100%;"
    src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hG9SzQxaCm8"
    frameborder="0"
    allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture"
    allowfullscreen
  >
  </iframe>
</div>

<p>The proposal of the video is simple. The variables designers tweak to control character movement should not be <code>gravity</code>, <code>acceleration</code>, etc. They should be <code>jump_height</code>, <code>jump_distance</code>, <code>time_to_jump_peak</code>, <code>time_to_max_speed</code>, etc. It&rsquo;s much easier to reason about the distance a player can jump to build a level than the combination of gravity and other physics variables.</p>
<p>Additionally, we implemented a very simple <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/5da19b57e42014a3a9f26b64c782a51b5925a39c/game/Player/Air.gd#L33">Coyote Time</a>. This gives players a grace period to jump even if the character has left a platform. Tiny thing, but it makes the experience a lot more responsive.</p>
<h3 id="-procedural-level-generation">‚úÖ Procedural level generation</h3>
<p>The game is a procedurally-generated infinite side-scroller. However, we do not procedurally place tiles. We have 8 hand crafted chunks. Then, the <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/blob/5da19b57e42014a3a9f26b64c782a51b5925a39c/game/Levels/InfiniteLevelManager.gd"><code>InfiniteLevelManager</code></a> script is responsible for randomly selecting the next chunk as the player approaches the end of the current chunk. Finally, it populates the chunk with enemies and ammo pickups.</p>
<p><a href="../img/plague/levelchunk.png">
  <img src="../img/plague/levelchunk.png" alt="level chunk">

</a></p>
<p>This gave us an infinite scroller with a very simple procedural generation algorithm and super tight control over the end result. We even managed to progressively increase difficulty by spawning more and tougher enemies.</p>
<p>With more time, we would have increased the variation and potentially procedurally place decoration on top of the blocks instead of having it built-in.</p>
<h3 id="-re-using-assets">‚úÖ Re-using assets</h3>
<p>Jay and I are both engineers and not very good at art. It was a wise decision to leverage multiple asset packs. This led to good feedback on both audio and visuals.</p>
<ul>
<li>üîâ <a href="https://opengameart.org/content/512-sound-effects-8-bit-style">The Essential Retro Video Game Sound Effects Collection</a> by <a href="https://opengameart.org/users/subspaceaudio">SubSpaceAudio</a></li>

<li>üåü <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/assets/particle-pack">Particle pack</a> by <a href="https://www.kenney.nl/">Kenney</a></li>

</ul>
<p>There are so many super high quality free assets, it&rsquo;s insane. If your jam allows it and you have a similar skillset to ours, go for it!</p>
<h3 id="-time-for-polish">‚úÖ Time for polish</h3>
<p>We dedicated a big chunk of the last day for polish and juiciness, which massively increased the game&rsquo;s perceived quality.</p>
<ul>
<li>üé• Camera shake for damage and bullet impacts.</li>
<li>ü¶ò Coyote time for jumps.</li>
<li>üéÆ Gamepad controls. The game detects Xbox/PS4 controller or keyboard and shows different instructions in the main menu.</li>
<li>‚õàÔ∏è Weather effects. We added rain, lightning and thunder that start at random intervals.</li>
<li>üåü Particles and SFX for everything that happens in the game.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="-automatic-deployment">‚úÖ Automatic deployment</h3>
<p>Right before the jam, I implemented a <a href="../continuous-delivery-pipeline-for-godot-and-itch.io/">Continuous Delivery pipeline</a> that exports the game and publishes to itch.io on every push to <code>master</code>. This completely removed the panic that typically happens when something goes wrong with game export right before the deadline.</p>
<p>You can also <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/godot-wild-jam-18/releases">go back in time</a> and see how the game looked at any point in time during development.</p>
<h2 id="-what-went-wrong">üëé What went wrong</h2>
<h3 id="-poor-use-of-theme">‚ùå Poor use of theme</h3>
<p>Due to some issues with the organisation, the theme announcement was delayed by half a day. Knowing that we weren&rsquo;t going to have much time to work on the game during the week, we started right away without a theme.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, we failed to go back to the theme and really incorporate it into the game. In the end, you can interpret that the monsters are the &ldquo;plague&rdquo;. Other games like <a href="https://joel127.itch.io/harvestor-3000">Harvestor-3000</a> and <a href="https://heyyeh.itch.io/ceefax">Ceefax</a> made a much better use of the theme.</p>
<p>By the way, this is not a complaint about the organisation at all. We really appreciate their efforts to keep the jam going!</p>
<h3 id="-lack-of-end-goal">‚ùå Lack of end goal</h3>
<p>The infinite platformer concept made people feel a lack of purpose. We didn&rsquo;t save top scores, so there was obvious sense of improvement nor progression.</p>
<p>An alternative may have been to introduce a final boss and an end-game after a fixed number of chunks. Lack of time!</p>
<h3 id="-yet-another-platformer">‚ùå Yet another platformer</h3>
<p>The game is a simple platformer and the procedural generation was not enough to make it fresh. That is why we scored the lowest in originality, ranking 28th or 65th percentile.</p>
<p>In future jams, we should prioritize a differentiating feature and really go with it. Hopefully, foundational things like getting movement right will take less time going forward.</p>
<h2 id="-thanks">‚úåÔ∏è Thanks!</h2>
<p>I had a blast participating in the jam. Thank you for reading this postmortem and thanks to everyone who played the game and gave us feedback.</p>
