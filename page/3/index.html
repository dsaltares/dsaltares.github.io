      This story really upset me, but let&rsquo;s start from the beginning for context&rsquo;s sake.
I&rsquo;ve been following Chris Hildenbrand&rsquo;s blog 2D Game Art for Programmers since the very beginning because it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing. He gives hope to talentless and desperate programmers like me, so we can go and make games that won&rsquo;t make people want to pull their eyes out. Just a few intelligently placed shapes, some smart shading and you&rsquo;ve got decent art.

      Yesterday, I had the pleasure to deliver a talk about Libgdx at the London Java Community Meetup. To my surprise, there was a pretty decent turnout. The audience was lovely, seemed engaged and asked quite a few questions. No awkward silence at the end.
Woohoo!
Thanks a lot to everyone who attended, and to the organisers who made it possible. We must catch up next time at the pub afterwards!

      Next Tuesday 3rd of February I will be talking about Libgdx at the London Java Community Meetup. Things won&rsquo;t get too technical, I&rsquo;ll introduce the framework, explain why it&rsquo;s so awesome, show who is currently using it in commercial products and give a quick demo at the end. Of course I won&rsquo;t miss this golden opportunity to cheekily mention my Libgdx Cookbook!
If you&rsquo;re interested, sign up and come to the The Skills Matter eXchange, doors open at 6.

      As you can see, Ashley development has slowed down a bit. I would like to think it&rsquo;s because we have a feature rich and stable framework rather than people having lost interest! Anyhow, there&rsquo;s still been quite a bit of progress, enough to warrant a new release.
Ashley 1.3.3 is now out.
API addition: added getEntity() method to Engine, it is now possible to retrieve entities by their ID. This will ease networked entity systems.

      While doing some cleanup of old feature branches, I accidentally deleted one that hadn&rsquo;t been pushed to origin yet. However, I didn&rsquo;t realise at the time.
After a couple of weeks, a hundred commits and many other branches mingling about, I found myself looking for the one I had previously deleted.
Oh noes!
Luckily for me, Git is somewhat idiot-proof and rarely truly deletes anything. Using git reflog you can list the tip of branches, including the deleted ones.

      I recently had the pleasure to attend a few lectures by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. He&rsquo;s a software consultant, speaker and fierce advocate of agile methodologies as well as TDD. Not only were the talks entertaining, but also deeply inspirational.
Seeking more information on his ideas, I decided that it would be good to take a look at his flagship book, Clean Code.
And so I read it.

      Last Monday 24th of November I delivered a small lecture about Libgdx at Kingston University of London. This complements Alberto&rsquo;s Libgdx workshop at Cadiz University last week as part of a series of activities to promote Libgdx and our recently released book.
I talked about what Libgdx can offer developers as well as the advantages of using open source tools as opposed to proprietary technologies, especially when it comes to students.

      Alberto Cejas, colleague and co-author of Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook delivered a Libgdx workshop at Cadiz University (Spain) last Friday 21st of November.
During a 2 hour session, the students put together a bunch of pieces to build Flappy Plane, a Flappy Bird clone originally developed by Mario Zechner. Moreover, there was free stuff! Alberto did a small raffle and gave two copies of our book away.
We&rsquo;re really happy with the turnout, just take a look at the gallery below!

      More features, bug fixes and improvements for Ashley entity framework on this new release.
API addition: we now use a builder pattern to create Family objects. More about it on the wiki. API addition: new SortedIteratingSystem by Lusito. API addition: now ImmutableArray implements the Iterable interface, which makes it a lot easier to iterate over entity collections. Bug fix: avoid double entity removal by accident. Bug fix: fixes StackOverflowError when processing entity operations.

      I&rsquo;ll be delivering a small presentation to the games development students at Kingston University of London on Monday November 24th. The reason behind the talk is the recent publication of our Libgdx Cookbook, which is why I will be giving away two hard copies! Come along to hear me preach about all Libgdx things.
Naturally, I&rsquo;ll post the slides here for whoever&rsquo;s interested.

      After over a year of long hours after my day job, sweat, blood and tears, my colleague Alberto Cejas and I are extremely proud to announce that our Libgdx for Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook has finally been published.
The cookbook has over 75 practical recipes on how to get stuff done with Libgdx. It covers pretty much everything: graphics, input, audio, physics, maps, deployment and third-party extensions among many, many more.

      The Google Nexus product line has always been the reference when it came to affordable high end smartphones. However, that seems to have changed a couple of days ago, the second the Nexus 6 was announced with a starting price tag of $649. Let us not forget that one could get a Nexus 5 for only $349.
As many have pointed out, this is most likely Google&rsquo;s response to the pressure other vendors have put on the former.

      Small stability release for Ashley entity framework this time.
Bug fix: fixed IllegalArgumentException thrown when trying to remove components from an already reset entity. The call has no effect now. Thanks for that SgtCoDFish.
Bug fix: fixed family match failure due to silly silly hashing.
Bug fix: fixed entity.getId() always returning `` for recycled pooled entities.
Bug fix: fixed nested iteration problem caused by adding/removing entities from an entity added/removed listener handler.

      Time for another Ashley entity framework release! This time, the focus has been on stability by getting rid of as many bugs as we could find. Check all the new goodies below.
API addition: adds IntervalSystem and IntervalIteratingSystem, which are updated at a fixed interval. API addition: adds getEntities() to IteratingSystem and IntervalIteratingSystem. API change: entities use long as ID. Changes entity.getIndex() for entity.getId(). Ids are reset to 0 after the entity is removed from the engine.

      As I have mentioned before, I have been working on a book titled Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook, which is set to be released next month.
Me and my co-author Alberto used a Git repository throughout the text and sample code development process. Using Gource, I have created a video that illustrates the repository&rsquo;s evolution. Neat, isn&rsquo;t it?
For those interested, here are the options I used.

      There have been quite a few things happening in Ashley during the past month, enough to call for a brand new release. Ashley 1.2.0 can now be fetched from Maven Central and this is what you&rsquo;ll find new.
API addition: people requested to put Entity#getComponent(Class) back in, so we accepted SgtCODFish‘s PR. ComponentMapper is still the most efficient and encouraged method to retrieve an entity&rsquo;s components. API addition: added PooledEngine#clearPools() to delete unused entity and component pool memory.

      Just under a month of the first official release we are ready to release a new stable version: Ashley 1.1.0. Here is the list of changes.
Performance improvements: massive performance gains with O(1) component retrieval through ComponentMapper and the use of Array&lt;Entity&gt; rather than IntMap&lt;Entity&gt;. Unfortunately this changes the API slightly, but hopefully you guys will appreciate the benefits. Complete Ashley manual: now the wiki has a lot more content, it fully covers Ashley.

      Ashley now has a logo and it&rsquo;s awesome! What an amazing contribution.
This is really good news because Ashley lacked an image to make it a bit more memorable. Now back to work, there will soon be a new release. Despite it involving some API changes, it will make for a much faster framework.

      Ashley, your favourite entity framework now has online javadocs and a wiki.
Wooohooo!
The javadocs correspond to the latest repository snapshot. Our Jenkins instance grabs the code, runs the tests, builds the jars and publishes the javadocs to the badlogic.com server. Kudos to Mario for the setup.
I just started putting stuff into the wiki yesterday so it&rsquo;s pretty empty as of now. Expect more content soon!

      Ashley Super Jumper has been my weekend project. It is nothing more than a clone of the Libgdx demo game. The catch is that it goes for an entity system approach rather than the classic inheritance model. Naturally, it uses Ashley.
The point was to have a reference project folks could check out in order to understand how entity systems in general and Ashley in particular work.
Maybe one day, I&rsquo;ll post a proper article explaining the design behind the entity systems at play in Super Jumper.

      Last night I added Ashley support to the official Libgdx setup tool. Creating Libgdx projects that use Ashley entity framework is now even easier. Simply make sure you tick the Ashley checkbox before generating your project.
By the way, if you already have a a project, adding the extra dependency is also trivial.
Core project: com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1 Android project: com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1 GWT project: com.badlogicgames.ashley:ashley:1.0.1:sources Remember that using Ashley in non Libgdx projects is also perfectly fine.

      This blog is now a lustrum old. A few days ago I received the yearly invoice from the hosting company, curiosity kicked in and made me check the date for the first one. I was surprised to see it&rsquo;s from July 2009 and thought a recap was in order.
It might have been possible to say that 5 years can make a blog be referred to as veteran. If we were in 2010.

      Finally! During the past couple of months me and a bunch of awesome collaborators have been working on a proper Ashley release and now it&rsquo;s done. Here is the list of the new shiny features.
Mind that some of them break the previous API. However, this is our first official release, we&rsquo;ll push hard to keep the API backwards compatible from now on.
Gradle: we got rid of the Eclipse projects and now use Gradle to manage our dependencies and build process.

      Loads of stuff in the pipeline lately: new job, finishing my book and some Ashley development. What? You don&rsquo;t know what Ashley is? Here is a brief, straight from GitHub.
A tiny entity framework written in Java. It&rsquo;s inspired by frameworks like Ash (hence the name) and Artemis. Ashley tries to be a high-performance entity framework without the use of black-magic and thus making the API easy and transparent to use.

      Almost a year ago, I started working on a Libgdx recipe book with Alberto Cejas, an old University mate. Now, Packt Publishing, have announced the project on their website, Libgdx Cross-platform Development Cookbook.
You can even pre-order a printed copy or the e-book version (DRM free).
Exciting times!
The book offers step-by-step guides on how to master Libgdx subsystems to build 2D games that run almost everywhere: Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac, Android, iOS and browsers.

      You&rsquo;ll have to excuse some Homefront: The Revolution spam in the blog these days. E3 2014 is on and, for the very first time, they&rsquo;re showing gameplay of the game I worked on at Crytek UK for two years. Exciting!
Without further ado, I&rsquo;ll let you see how awesome it looks.

      At last! The game I worked on during my 2 years at Crytek UK has been announced with an amazing trailer. Big congratulations at the Nottingham team for the huge effort put into this project. What a bunch of incredibly talented people, I&rsquo;m really honoured to have been part of the project.
I mainly worked on emergent AI systems for NPCs and animation. Unfortunately, you cannot see much of that on this trailer.

      As I mentioned here a few days ago, last weekend I entered the 29th edition of the Ludum Dare game jam, which had Beneath the surface as a theme. To be completely honest, I was only bothered to work on the project for about 4 hours each day. That probably explains why is my worst game jam entry so far.
Beneath the surface is a very simple, classic text adventure where the player needs to escape an underground cave by using commands in the form of verb object like:
