      </span>
      
      <p>For the past few weeks working on a new toy: <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/conjugate">Conjugate</a>. It&rsquo;s probably easier if I just stick a summary of the GitHub readme here.</p>
<p>Conjugate is a verb conjugator service. Enter a verb in English and get the conjugations for all tenses in a variety of languages.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/conjugate/languages.jpg" alt="languages.jpg">

</p>
<h3 id="reason-to-be">Reason to be</h3>
<p>When learning a new language, it is very common to struggle with verb conjugations. For example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I want to know the third person singular form (masculine) of the future perfect tense of the verb to eat in French.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Unfortunately, the available resources are somehow limited:</p>
<ul>
<li>Google translator: usually gets conjugations wrong for most languages, especially in terms of gender.</li>
<li>Apps: seriously? I don&rsquo;t want to install yet another app!</li>
<li>Websites: lists are limited, the sites are old, full of ads and/or don&rsquo;t play well with mobile devices.</li>
</ul>
<p>Conjugate tries to solve that use case.</p>
<h3 id="project-structure">Project structure</h3>
<p>The project is divided in two parts:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scraper</li>
<li>Mobile friendly website</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="scraper">Scraper</h4>
<p>I wrote a <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/conjugate/tree/master/scraping">web scraper</a> in Python using <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/beautifulsoup4">BeautifulSoup4</a> that grabs translation and conjugation data from <a href="http://www.verbix.com/">Verbix</a>. This site doesn&rsquo;t work very well on mobile, their API returns a 404 and their e-mail address is no longer valid. Honestly, I feared their comprehensive database is going to be lost at some point in the near future. Besides, they allow people to user their data for non profit purposes.</p>
<p>The script currently supports Romanian (which I&rsquo;m trying to learn) and Spanish. Luckily, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to add support for new languages, although no thanks to Verbix&rsquo;s poor use of web standards.</p>
<h4 id="website">Website</h4>
<p>Currently, I&rsquo;m in the process of writing the mobile friendly application. It&rsquo;ll be extremely simple:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enter a verb in English (infinitive).</li>
<li>Select a language from a dropdown.</li>
<li>Hit &ldquo;Go&rdquo;.</li>
</ol>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/conjugate/flask.png" alt="flask.png">

</p>
<p>For the backend I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://flask.pocoo.org/docs/0.10/">Flask</a> and <a href="http://www.sqlalchemy.org/">sqlalchemy</a> to keep things in the Python world, not to mention that they&rsquo;re really easy to get started with. Not too sure about the frontend, but I&rsquo;ll probably go for a framework that makes responsive design simple enough.</p>
<p>Any suggestions?</p>
<h3 id="progress">Progress</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been pretty lazy these days, blame it on FarCry 4 and Daredevil but I hope to report some progress on the project soon. Of course, I&rsquo;d be more than happy to accept PR&rsquo;s if you&rsquo;re interested to help!</p>

        <a href="https://saltares.com/general/new-domain-and-hosting/">New domain and hosting</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Mar 22, 2015 &middot; 2 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/general/new-domain-and-hosting/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>

      </span>
      
      <p>It&rsquo;s been <a href="../../general/5-years-old/">over 5 years</a> since I registered <code>siondream.com</code>. At that time, I also signed up for a shared hosting plan with <a href="http://hostgator.com/">Hostgator</a>. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m no longer 16 years old, so the domain felt a bit dated. A change was long overdue, but I can be real lazy during the weekend. Finally I got around to do a proper migration of both domain name and hosting.</p>
<p>Welcome to <code>saltares.com</code>!</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a brief of my experience with Hostgator and the migration process.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/others/hostgator.png" alt="hostgator.png">

</p>
<p>Hostgator wasn&rsquo;t actually that bad. It had excellent client support and my plan offered &ldquo;unlimited&rdquo; disk space and monthly data transfer at a fair price. However, at the end of the day, both were limited by the number of people you shared your instance with. In all honestly, the uptime could have been better as it wasn&rsquo;t rare for me to get notifications about the blog being unreachable.</p>
<p>The worst part about Hostgator were the access limitations. I couldn&rsquo;t just run whatever software I wanted on the server. Whilst it supported PHP, I believe Java or Python weren&rsquo;t among the list. I simply didn&rsquo;t have the permissions to install anything.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/others/digitalocean.png" alt="digitalocean.png">

</p>
<p>A few friends have <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/">Digital Ocean</a> droplets and are very happy with the service, so I went for it and got my Ubuntu SSD machine. I took advantage of the <a href="https://education.github.com/pack">GitHub student pack</a>, which offers a $100 voucher, meaning I don&rsquo;t have to pay at all for the first 20 months.</p>
<p>Yes, you have to set absolutely everything up yourself, including a web server, PHP, MySQL, etc. Conveniently, Digital Ocean&rsquo;s website has a myriad of <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials">tutorials</a> with detailed steps on how to do all of this. Great way to polish up my rusty Linux skills.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/others/namecheap.png" alt="namecheap.png">

</p>
<p>After digging around for a bit, I registered <code>saltares.com</code> with <a href="https://www.namecheap.com/">Namecheap</a>. Despite being put off by the name, a lot of people recommended it and now I can see why. The DNS setup propagated extremely quickly and there is no fuss. Additionally, it&rsquo;s really easy to find a <a href="http://www.namecheapcoupons.com/">discount code</a>, so I got the domain during a year for £6, not bad.</p>
<p>All of this should have been seamless for everyone, so please contact me if something is not working quite well. Requests to <code>siondream.com</code> now point to my droplet, so the old domain points to the same thing as <code>saltares.com</code>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a few months since <a href="https://www.packtpub.com/game-development/libgdx-cross-platform-game-development-cookbook">Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook</a> came out. Quite a few things have happened since then in the Libgdx world, libraries are updated and some things break over time.</p>
<p>As promised, we have updated our <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdx-cookbook">samples repository</a> to use the latest versions of Libgdx (1.5.5), Ashley (1.4.0), gdx-ai (1.5.0) and RoboVM (1.0.0) among others. Luckily enough, <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/libgdx-cookbook/commit/380ee2ea90481f2b80b62df2dccd312db0af7964">only a few changes</a> were necessary to make everything work again.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased to see that, 5 months after the book came out, it&rsquo;s still as relevant as it was on launch day. Moreover, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Libgdx-Cross-platform-Game-Development-Cookbook/dp/1783287292/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1426806867&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=libgdx+cookbook">people seem to like it!</a></p>

<p>A new version of <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley">Ashley</a>, your favourite component based entity framework is out. The <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/releases/tag/ashley-1.4.0">1.4.0</a> version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/d6222d9ee0cca6f06dd61b04bae6d092497425a5">API deprecation</a></strong>: finallt removed the <code>Family.getFor()</code> methods. In order to retrieve a family, you can do <code>Family.all().one().exclude().get()</code>.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/137">API change</a></strong>: makes family <code>Builder</code> package protected.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/356cf4097f7c870cccc67cffca62ff3f32f103da">Bug fix</a></strong>: <code>EntityOperation</code> and <code>ComponentOperation</code> are now properly reset when put back into their pools. This doesn&rsquo;t affect the API at all and it&rsquo;s an implementation detail fix.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/eff243f65e98a57c5e1a8045f85465cd1acf085d">Bug fix</a></strong>: fixes <code>PooledEngine</code> always returning new components.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/issues/135">Bug fix</a></strong>: fixes GWT build.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/libgdx/ashley/commit/cf7a02006d2269cd64976de6e7b56bd7553708de">Bug fix</a></strong>: avoids removing a <code>PooledEntity</code> twice.</li>
</ul>
<p>To use it, change your dependency to <code>com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.4.0</code>. The new nightly dependency is <code>com.badlogicgames.gdx:ashley:1.4.1-SNAPSHOT</code>.</p>
<p>As usual, <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com:8080/job/ashley/">all unit tests are passing</a> and the wiki is up to date. Please keep up the good work sending more pull requests and reporting bugs.</p>

      <span class="post-date">Mar 12, 2015 &middot; 2 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/general/2d-game-art-for-programmers-copyright-infringement/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>

  <img src="../../img/wp/2d-game-art-for-programmers.jpg" alt="2d-game-art-for-programmers.jpg">

</p>
<p>This story really upset me, but let&rsquo;s start from the beginning for context&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been following Chris Hildenbrand&rsquo;s blog <a href="http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.co.uk/">2D Game Art for Programmers</a> since the very beginning because it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing. He gives hope to talentless and desperate programmers like me, so we can go and make games that won&rsquo;t make people want to pull their eyes out. Just a few intelligently placed shapes, some smart shading and you&rsquo;ve got decent art. Moreover, everything is done with Inkscape, which is free and open source.</p>
<p>Splendid!</p>
<p>2D Game Art for Programmers has enabled me to produce art for <a href="../../games/math-maze/">Math Maze</a> and <a href="../../game-jams/evolution/">Evolution</a> among other stuff. Hey, they look pretty okay to me, don&rsquo;t they? Thanks for that, Chris.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/math-maze/math-maze-phone.jpg" alt="math-maze-phone.jpg">

</p>
<p>Chris&rsquo; tutorials are well thought out and beautifully crafted. They must take bloody hours to put together! In order to justify such an enormous time investment, Chris has a few premium assets and guides for which you have to pay a small amount of money. One example are his <a href="http://2dblockbuddies.blogspot.co.uk/p/blockbuddies.html">Block Buddies</a>.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/BlockBuddies_sticker_update.jpg" alt="BlockBuddies_sticker_update.jpg">

</p>
<p>Now for the outrageous part.</p>
<p>Last weekend Chris contacted me about <a href="https://www.viope.com/#!/">Viope</a>, an e-learning company. They had shamelessly created a 129€ (£92/$137) tutorial directly from his free assets. I&rsquo;m not talking about them using Chris&rsquo; tutorials to learn and then make a paid course of their own, which would have been legitimate. This is a 1:1 copy of the original work. Additionally, they copied other tutorials and published them as free samples of the course.</p>
<p>Chris gives <a href="http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/wtf-thank-you-very-much-viope.html">more details on his website</a>.</p>
<p>Hilariously, Viope made a promotional video which includes the character I made for Evolution. They are mad if they can attract customers with my art. Ridiculous.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/ld24/evolution-caveman-02.jpg" alt="evolution-caveman-02.jpg">

</p>
<p>Understandably, this affects Chris&rsquo; motivation to produce more awesome work for free. He was in the middle of publishing a series of articles on <a href="http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.co.uk/2015/03/complete-game-character-design.html">how to design art for a whole game from scratch</a>. He cannot get enough kudos for that.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s enraging to see how easy it is for an company of doubious morale to take possession of something it&rsquo;s not theirs and re-publish it for profit. Fortunately, Chris is talking to his lawyer and Viope seem to have taken the course down for the time being.</p>
<p>Hope it gets fixed soon mate.</p>
