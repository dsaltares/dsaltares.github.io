<p>A few months back, I was contacted by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> to see whether I was interested in being a technical reviewer for an upcoming libGDX book, to which I gladly accepted. Titled <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-libgdx-game-development/book">Learning libGDX Game Development</a>, goes through all the basic features while building a multi-platform project from scratch.</p>
<p>Andreas Oelhke, author, has done what I believe to be a pretty good job, mostly thanks to the incredibly practical approach he&rsquo;s taken. I&rsquo;ve read many game programming books that explain in depth how a given technology works, but don&rsquo;t teach the newcomer how to put everything together. Oh boy, I remember that feeling! Even though, it requires some basic games and Java knowledge, the reader will feel his hand held by the explanations at all times.</p>
<p>The book hits the reader towards deeper and more complex topics to expand on, which makes it an excellent starting point. It&rsquo;s not rare to encounter people in the forums asking too general questions because they don&rsquo;t know how to get something going and I believe this could fill the gap.</p>
<p>As I&quot;m not the author, I feel quite comfortable speaking highly about it. Learning libGDX Game Development is coming out this September, so make sure to check that out. Regardless of my little involvement, I&quot;m actually quite excited about it!</p>

<p>Math Maze is what&rsquo;s been keeping me busy after work for the past three months and now it&rsquo;s dangerously approaching a state I&quot;m happy with. Woohooo!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your head agile enough to succeed at this math based brain teaser game? Reach the exit of the labyrinth as fast as you can by using operations that will open the conditional blockages. Freshen up your mental calculus without even realising!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to make a really simple Android game so as to be able to polish it without giving up my job nor my social life. Then I came across with this <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=4628">Ludum Dare game</a> and loved the concept. Reduced scope, perfect for short play sessions on a mobile device and an interesting educational flavour that convinced me to target kids.</p>
<p>Last week I launched a closed alpha through Google Play and Google Plus. Involving relatives and friends as soon as I could has proven to be of huge help. The alpha resulted in very positive feedback and loads of design suggestions which are going to help me make a better game. Also a couple of bugs were found, so I would expect the final version to be pretty solid. Actually, I even put together a questionnaire and may even publish some of the conclusions I got from it.</p>
<p>All they say about how important is early external playtesting is true. Do it.</p>
<p>So far it&rsquo;s been excellent. Math Maze is coming together nicely and I&quot;m learning loads about libgdx, user experience for kids and general game development. Don&rsquo;t take me wrong, it&rsquo;s a tiny game, but I&quot;m humbly happy with it. If I could focus on some PR towards launch, that&quot;d be just fantastic.</p>

<p>Last week I went to <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=develop%20brighton&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.d2k&amp;biw=1097&amp;bih=541&amp;ion=1&amp;pf=p&amp;pdl=300&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;ei=HXnkUbHZBqe_0QXKroHYAw">Develop in Brighton</a> with work, had a great time and attended talks full of insight, so lucky me! While that might very well be a whole post on its own, I want to focus on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sweeney_(game_developer)">Tim Sweeney</a>&ldquo;s interview on the past and future of Unreal Engine and Epic Games. More specifically, on the fact that they&quot;ll be dropping their widely used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealScript">scripting language</a> entirely towards Unreal 4. Programmers will work exclusively with C++.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang on, what?! I&rsquo;ve been trying so hard to master it cause I heard it&quot;d get me a job in the industryâ€¦ Now what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly my point.</p>
<p>So many people, mostly games students, tend to focus way too much on proprietary technologies arguing a high demand for them within the industry. Today, the cool kid in the block is mostly Unity but Unreal also gets a piece of the cake. As much as that may be true at this point in time, it&rsquo;s a very dangerous long term investment. Please be aware that my argument doesn&rsquo;t apply if you&quot;re all about the fun of making games. If so, by all means, use whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, learning a cool engine is always useful. Quick prototyping and discovering real life workflows are, indeed, great perks. Nevertheless, restricting yourself can backfire big time. Those who didn&rsquo;t become good enough at C++ while they were playing around with the Unity scene editor, will have a much harder time getting a job once the company behind their fancy engine goes bankrupt or simply stops being popular.</p>
<p>As long as you&quot;re fluent using common data structures, know how a computer memory works, understand the concepts behind algorithmic complexity (big O) and are able to write clean, fast C++ code you&quot;ll be absolutely fine. Those skills are a must have in the games industry and even more so in AAA territory.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable with pointers? What about bit shifting? Avoiding string compares? Preventing memory leaks?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But loads of small and medium sized companies use Unity!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies want you to adapt quickly to their way of doing things and you&quot;ll become a much more versatile programmer by being decent at a low level language. Switching from C++ to C# is relatively easy while the opposite can quickly become an awful nightmare. Hey, you can always prove you&quot;re an amazingly fast learner by adding a scripting based project to your portfolio.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let modern shininess blind you. C++ will continue to be the most widely used language for games programming in the foreseeable future. Cool stuff will show up, but it might not be there tomorrow, don&rsquo;t bet everything on the same runner.</p>

<p>Most of my spare time for the last month or so has gone to an Android pet project, which partially explains the lack of activity around here. However, such project gave me a little idea for a short tutorial flavoured article.</p>
<h3 id="level-design-practically-a-synonym-of-iteration">Level design, practically a synonym of iteration</h3>
<p>Everybody knows how essential iteration is for games development. Ideas tend to look awesome on paper, yet most of them perform poorly when implemented. Throwing away whole features and reworking others surely isn&rsquo;t new territory for you. Level designers probably know this better than anyone. Creating a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNctAEfR97A">greybox level</a> and making hundreds of changes until it flows nicely and artist can know for sure where everything is going to be.</p>
<p>Tools like <a href="http://www.crydev.net/index.php">CryEngine SandBox</a> allow lightning fast iteration by letting the creator jump into game straight from the editor to test setups. The change something and test it cycle flows incredibly nicely and no time is wasted with annoying loading screens.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/CryENGINE-inital-scene.jpg" alt="CryENGINE-inital-scene.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="iteration-can-be-cumbersome">Iteration can be cumbersome</h3>
<p>Nevertheless, I&quot;m using <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a>Â (check out the new website)Â along <a href="http://www.mapeditor.org/">Tiled</a> to make this pet project and things are different under this environment. Normally, one would go through the following process:</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a level with Tiled.</li>
<li>Add it to the list of levels in the game. This could involve changed in an XML file or, much worse, fiddling with the source code.</li>
<li>Launch the game and navigate the menus until you find the newly created level.</li>
<li>Finally test it.</li>
<li><em>&ldquo;Oh, I need to move this obstacle a bit to the left&rdquo;</em>.</li>
<li>Back to 1, not before wishing to be stabbed in the face.</li>
</ul>
<p>You might think this is acceptable if a single iteration takes less than half a minute.</p>
<p>Wrong!</p>
<p>You&quot;ll be doing this a ridiculous number of times, so you better do yourself a favor and try shorten the process.</p>
<h3 id="tiled-command-tool-at-your-service">Tiled command tool at your service</h3>
<p>Luckily enough, we can use Tiled to execute any command passing the map file we&quot;re currently editing as a parameter from its main UI panel, it&rsquo;s almost as good as what CryEngine does. It only requires a little effort on our side, as the game needs to accept command line parameters and interpret them, we&quot;ll get to that later.</p>
<p>First, click on the gears icon in Tiled and then select <em>Edit Commands</em>. Create a new one and name it <em>Run level</em> for instance. The command will be executed from the Tiled folder, Program Files in my case. That&rsquo;s why I&quot;m using absolute paths to reach my game&rsquo;s executable.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>java -jar E:projectsmathmazemath.jar %mapfile
</code></pre><p><img src="../../img/wp/tiled-command.png" alt="tiled-command.png"></p>
<p>The <em>%mapfile</em> string is replaced by the absolute path to our level when the command is executed.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s time to make the game accept an absolute path as a parameter and load a specific level when that happens, without going through all the menus. In my case I did something similar to this.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class Main {
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		String level =  args.length &gt; 0 ? args[0] : &quot;&quot;;
		new LwjglApplication(new MyGame(level), new LwjglApplicationConfiguration());
	}
}
</code></pre><p>Then, in <em>MyGame</em> create method.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>if (!mapFile.empty() {
	Level level = new Level(mapFile);
	gameScreen.setLevel(level);
	gameScreen.setDebug(true);
	setScreen(gameScreen);
}
else {
	setScreen(splashScreen);	
}
</code></pre><p>Within <em>GameScreen</em> I had to detect whether we were in debug mode and, if so, think of the level as an absolute path.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>if (isDebug()) {
	mapLoader = new TmxMapLoader(new AbsoluteFileHandleResolver());
}
else {
	mapLoader = new TmxMapLoader();
}

TiledMap map = mapLoader.load(getLevel());
</code></pre><p>I noticed that libgdx doesn&rsquo;t include an absolute path file handle resolver, so I created it. Otherwise, it&quot;d think the file path is of the relative kind.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class AbsoluteFileHandleResolver implements FileHandleResolver {
	@Override
	public FileHandle resolve(String fileName) {
		return Gdx.files.absolute(fileName);
	}
}
</code></pre><p>The last step was to export the game as a runnable jar to make it accessible from Tiled. After this, we can now finally run our level directly just by clicking on the gears icon. It requires some initial investment but I can assure you it pays off.</p>
<p>Easy as pie and fast!</p>

      <p><img src="../../img/freegemas/freegemas-banner.png" alt="banner-blog.png"></p>
<p>That I know ofâ€¦</p>
<p>For those who don&rsquo;t know, <a href="../../games/freegemas-for-android-and-html5/" title="Freegemas libgdx">Freegemas</a> was my first <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a> project, which I made in a couple of weeks to learn how to use the framework. Actually, I&quot;m not to take the credit as it&rsquo;s a silly Java/libgdx port of a game made by an university mate, <a href="http://josetomastocino.com/">JosÃ© TomÃ¡s Tocino</a>. Freegemas was originally <a href="https://code.google.com/p/freegemas/">written in C++ using Gosu</a> and both versions were <a href="https://code.google.com/p/freegemas-libgdx/">open sourced under the GPL license</a>.</p>
<p>Both are non profit games and are clearly inspired in the successful Bejeweled.</p>
<p>Freegemas added Android and <a href="freegemas">HTML5</a> to the list of supported platforms and was published on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.freegemas">Google Play</a> as a free app over a year ago.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/freegemas/freegemas-02.png" alt="javaw-2012-04-18-08-45-49-21-1024x576.png"></p>
<h3 id="freegemas-clone-wars">Freegemas Clone wars</h3>
<p>Last week I got an email from an Android developer reporting that Freegemas libgdx had been ripped by a different developer called <a href="https://plus.google.com/100071464175146489197">Barrilete CÃ³smico</a>. The allegedly offending app was Candy Time Crush, whose name, absent doubt, comes after the popular Facebook game.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/candy-time-crush.png" alt="candy-time-crush.png"></p>
<p>Indeed, this Candy thing was a 1:1 Freegemas clone only changing two elements, he changed the textures and added a shitload of aggressive adverts. Just look at the required permissions to get the extent of it.</p>
<ul>
<li>Full network access â€“ Fair enough for basic ads.</li>
<li>Phone calls â€“ Why? The original doesn&rsquo;t need it.</li>
<li>Storage â€“ Legit to read assets from memory.</li>
<li>Install shortcuts without user intervention â€“ I&quot;m sorry, WHAT?</li>
</ul>
<p>I proceeded to download this Freegemas mutation to make absolutely sure the app had profitability as main purpose and oh boy it did! Shit started to pop up all over the place deeming the game unplayable. I closed it immediately only to see a few new shortcuts linking to dubious products on my dashboard. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>But why not let other users give their opinions? You could argue I&quot;m quite biased and since they come in all sorts of flavors, here they are.</p>
<p>From the self explanatory and verbose.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Emma Cheneler</strong>: It crashed my mob had to take battery out to even switch mob off. Bad bad bad.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Helen Shaw</strong>: crashed. rebooted and messed up my phone all before i got to play the gameâ€¦. DOn&rsquo;t DOWNLOADâ€¦..</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To the plain and simple.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Anthony Hernandez</strong>: Hate it!!.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ironically, the joke&rsquo;s on my because Candy Time Crush is a clone of my our own game. I&quot;m perfectly aware of the limitations and scope of Freegemas. It was made in under 2 weeks after work for $deity&rsquo;s sake! However, our pet project is free, has no ads and its code has helped other people learn about libgdx since it was featured in the framework&rsquo;s documentation.</p>
<p>Oh, and it doesn&rsquo;t make your phone crash.</p>
<p>When I checked Barrilete CÃ³smico&rsquo;s (license offender) Google Play panel I was completely astonished. Candy Time Crush was not the only Freegemas clone, there were a total of four of them. It&rsquo;s ridiculous! My surprise spiked even more when I realised the download count was over 500K in aggregate, and all those apps featured the same kind of ads. What the hell?</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/farm-time-hero.png" alt="farm-time-hero-300x145.png"></p>
<h3 id="of-the-gpl-license">Of the GPL license</h3>
<p>I wanted to clarify some of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html">details of GPL</a> to illustrate why this is a shameless trespass of the license. The relevant portion is that you can copy, modify and redistribute the software as long as you make the new version available under a compatible license. And that&rsquo;s the essence of it.</p>
<p>Taking someone else&rsquo;s GPL code and redistributing it with minor changes for profit without crediting the original authors could easily be flagged as unethical. Nevertheless, that&rsquo;s legally irrelevant. What matters is that it&rsquo;s perfectly legal when the developer makes the code open source the code as well.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s fine with me. Hell! It was us who went for this license in the first place.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, this guy did no such thing.</p>
<h3 id="reactions">Reactions</h3>
<p>After discussing it with the Freegemas original author we decided to file a <a href="https://support.google.com/bin/static.py?hl=en&amp;ts=1114905&amp;page=ts.cs">copyright infringement report</a> and send it to Google with little hope they&quot;d answer. I also emailed the author explaining the situation and listing his options.</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove all the clones from Google Play.</li>
<li>Make their source code available under GPL.</li>
<li>Get to a commercial agreement with us to split advertisement revenue.</li>
</ul>
<p>We knew the latter wasn&rsquo;t going to happen and we wouldn&rsquo;t be very happy to be a part of all that aggressive advertising anyway. Personally, I don&rsquo;t think Freegemas should have those pretensions, it&rsquo;s too simple of a game, a two week tiny hack project with educational purposes.</p>
<p>He got back to me in roughly ten minutes saying he was sorry and that he was unaware of the illegality of his actions and that he took our game just to learn the ads process. He said he had ceased distribution of all four games. Well, that was fast.</p>
<p>On a side note, no one makes four identical games <em>&ldquo;just to learn&rdquo;</em>.</p>
<p>I was surprised to see Google&rsquo;s response to the complaint just a couple of days later. Obviously the games had been removed so the links weren&rsquo;t working anymore. I said everything was fine now and that the process didn&rsquo;t need to carry on.</p>
<p>End of story.</p>
<p>Well, not really.</p>
<p>Today I realised the developer changed his name to <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/developer?id=CCM">CCM</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.rotember.candytime">Candy Time Crush</a> is still listed among his published applications. However, the description mentions Freegemas as base for this game and adds the following note.</p>

<p>Apparently that makes it comply with GPL v3 even though it sounds quite cheeky. Well nothing left to do here.</p>
<h3 id="morale-of-the-story">Morale of the story</h3>
<p>It would be sad to think of the morale to be that working on open source projects is a bad thing or a waste of time. There&rsquo;s always going to be people who try to take credit for the work of others, regardless of the context.</p>
<p>I love open source because it helps me broaden and enhance my skill set, it&rsquo;s good practice. Working in community is an enriching experience and most of the time I don&rsquo;t have monetisation pretensions at all. Open source and commercial software are two perfectly compatible concepts anyway. Take a look at the libgdx community, there are many developers who have paid sucessful software in the market whilst contributing back all the time. <a href="https://github.com/NathanSweet">Nathan</a> and <a href="http://esotericsoftware.com/">Spine</a> are a great example with his <a href="https://code.google.com/p/libgdx/wiki/scene2dui">Scene2D UI system</a>.</p>
<p>The conclusion here would be that there&rsquo;s a big need to raise awareness towards what software licenses mean, let alone the necessity of ethics in this field. On our end, we need to make sure the implications of the license our code is published under are perfectly clear and in a visible place.</p>
<p>Thanks to the fellow developer who reported this.</p>
