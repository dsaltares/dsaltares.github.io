      A lot of games come with a built-in console that lets you enter commands, which is especially useful during development. Most times, it gets disabled before shipping although, occasionally, devs let you bring it up and enter cheat codes. CryEngine comes with a built-in console.
 When you&quot;re testing a new feature you just wrote, it can be incredibly useful to pause, reset the scene, teleport your character, become invincible, switch to a different level or even adjust some parameters in the AI.

      In Sloppynauts the player had to remain undetected, avoiding CCTV cameras and alien baddies. We constantly had to determine who could see who and whether the player was hidden behind something. We wrote a nice reusable system using Ashley and Box2D and I think it&quot;d be a shame if it went to waste. So here it is in case you&quot;d like to use it.
This 2D vision system is generic enough to work with both side-scrolling and top-down games.

      After a crazy weekend before the deadline, we finally managed to put something playable together for LibGDXJAM.
We&quot;d love you to have a go, and leave some feedback.
 We are definitely aware of the shortcomings of the game. We spent a lot of the jam working on a custom Overlap2D level loader and not so much on actual content, so you can actually finish the game in under a minute.

      Oh my God, enter panic mode, just 8 days left until the #LibGDXJAM deadline! We&rsquo;ve been hard at work, especially @DrillerDev who&rsquo;s pushed the character design and animation.
Look at this bad boy for instance, better not to mess with his alien gun.
 Or the beholder powered alien surveillance.
 Please, ignore the placeholder environment art, it&rsquo;s the textures from the Overlap2D example project. Our chubby astronaut can run, crouch, jump and push boxes around.

      We&quot;re halfway through the #libGDXJAM and some work has been done between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s eve.
Here&rsquo;s a few updates.
 @DrillerDev as joined us as an artist and has already produced some awesome concepts. Alberto and I have been working on an Overlap2D scene loader and it&rsquo;s pretty much working supporting a bunch of things: composites, textures, lights, physics and particles. We have a somewhat buggy physics based platformer movement system.

      Check the keynote and all the awkward moments from the dev team, including mine!
The theme is Life in Space and I&quot;m teaming up with Alberto for #libGDXJAM and here&rsquo;s our idea:
 Abe&rsquo;s Oddysee meets This War of Mine meets Boogerman&hellip; in space!
 A bunch of dangerously unprepared astronauts land on a strange planet only to find out it&rsquo;s inhabited by big fat angry aliens with guns.

      Shortly after we moved Ashley into the Libgdx family, we started writing unit tests for every single component in the framework using jUnit.
Unit testing goodness That was over a year and a half ago and it has proven to be a huge win for many reasons.
 Issue reporters can (and should) include a test that breaks as a way of explaining the problem. We can then easily include it into the suite, fix it and prevent future regressions.

 API change: removed UUIDs from entities, users should implement their own ID system when needed. This helps with networked games. Update: components are added/removed immediately, listeners are notified after the current system finishes updating. Bug fix: fixed entity listeners not being called if a component is added inside another listener. Bug fix: does not allocate memory inside updateFamilyMembership().

      A new Ashley package has shipped, making 1.6.0 the latest stable version. Here&rsquo;s the summary of the changes:
 API change: Component is now an interface. API addition: adds getEngine() to EntitySystem. API addition: EntityListeners now are notified by priority order. API consistency: defines what happens when an Entity is added twice to an Engine and when we try do nested updates. We throw an exception in both cases. API consistency: adding an EntitySystem of the same class twice replaces the previous one, just like it has always happened when adding Components to an Entity.

      As I recently mentioned, a couple of weeks ago I flew to Stockholm to attend the Intel Buzz Workshop, a conference focused on mobile games development where I preached the perks of Libgdx. The event had a great turnout and my talk seemed to have been well received. Moreover, I also got to meet cool people IRL such as Adrian, the guy behind the Artemis ECS.
For those who missed it and would like to watch me ramble about how brilliant Libgdx is for a whole 20 minutes, here is the video.

      Haven&rsquo;t bought Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook yet? Stop reading and go get it!
Quick update to inform you that I just updated the samples repository to use Libgdx 1.6.0 and Ashley 1.5.0, both recently released.
Libgdx 1.6.0 introduces changes in our font rendering API, which require a few minor tweaks to the framework calls, nothing major.
7 months after the release of the book, we continue to support it.

      Thanks to the contributors, here&rsquo;s a new version of Ashley, which now stands at 1.5.0. A new version of your favorite component based entity framework is out.
The version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.
 API addition: adds getFamily() method to IntervalIteratingSystem and IteratingSystem. API change: IntervalSystem‘s update() method is now final, as it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to override it.

      For the past few weeks working on a new toy: Conjugate. It&rsquo;s probably easier if I just stick a summary of the GitHub readme here.
Conjugate is a verb conjugator service. Enter a verb in English and get the conjugations for all tenses in a variety of languages.
 Reason to be When learning a new language, it is very common to struggle with verb conjugations. For example:
 I want to know the third person singular form (masculine) of the future perfect tense of the verb to eat in French.

      It&rsquo;s been over 5 years since I registered siondream.com. At that time, I also signed up for a shared hosting plan with Hostgator. Unfortunately, I&rsquo;m no longer 16 years old, so the domain felt a bit dated. A change was long overdue, but I can be real lazy during the weekend. Finally I got around to do a proper migration of both domain name and hosting.
Welcome to saltares.com!
Here&rsquo;s a brief of my experience with Hostgator and the migration process.

      It&rsquo;s been a few months since Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook came out. Quite a few things have happened since then in the Libgdx world, libraries are updated and some things break over time.
As promised, we have updated our samples repository to use the latest versions of Libgdx (1.5.5), Ashley (1.4.0), gdx-ai (1.5.0) and RoboVM (1.0.0) among others. Luckily enough, only a few changes were necessary to make everything work again.

      A new version of Ashley, your favourite component based entity framework is out. The 1.4.0 version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.
 API deprecation: finallt removed the Family.getFor() methods. In order to retrieve a family, you can do Family.all().one().exclude().get(). API change: makes family Builder package protected. Bug fix: EntityOperation and ComponentOperation are now properly reset when put back into their pools.

      This story really upset me, but let&rsquo;s start from the beginning for context&rsquo;s sake.
I&rsquo;ve been following Chris Hildenbrand&rsquo;s blog 2D Game Art for Programmers since the very beginning because it&rsquo;s absolutely amazing. He gives hope to talentless and desperate programmers like me, so we can go and make games that won&rsquo;t make people want to pull their eyes out. Just a few intelligently placed shapes, some smart shading and you&rsquo;ve got decent art.

      Yesterday, I had the pleasure to deliver a talk about Libgdx at the London Java Community Meetup. To my surprise, there was a pretty decent turnout. The audience was lovely, seemed engaged and asked quite a few questions. No awkward silence at the end.
 Woohoo!
 Thanks a lot to everyone who attended, and to the organisers who made it possible. We must catch up next time at the pub afterwards!

      Next Tuesday 3rd of February I will be talking about Libgdx at the London Java Community Meetup. Things won&rsquo;t get too technical, I&rsquo;ll introduce the framework, explain why it&rsquo;s so awesome, show who is currently using it in commercial products and give a quick demo at the end. Of course I won&rsquo;t miss this golden opportunity to cheekily mention my Libgdx Cookbook!
If you&rsquo;re interested, sign up and come to the The Skills Matter eXchange, doors open at 6.

      As you can see, Ashley development has slowed down a bit. I would like to think it&rsquo;s because we have a feature rich and stable framework rather than people having lost interest! Anyhow, there&rsquo;s still been quite a bit of progress, enough to warrant a new release.
Ashley 1.3.3 is now out.
 API addition: added getEntity() method to Engine, it is now possible to retrieve entities by their ID.

      While doing some cleanup of old feature branches, I accidentally deleted one that hadn&rsquo;t been pushed to origin yet. However, I didn&rsquo;t realise at the time.
After a couple of weeks, a hundred commits and many other branches mingling about, I found myself looking for the one I had previously deleted.
 Oh noes!
 Luckily for me, Git is somewhat idiot-proof and rarely truly deletes anything. Using git reflog you can list the tip of branches, including the deleted ones.

      I recently had the pleasure to attend a few lectures by Robert C. Martin, also known as Uncle Bob. He&rsquo;s a software consultant, speaker and fierce advocate of agile methodologies as well as TDD. Not only were the talks entertaining, but also deeply inspirational.
Seeking more information on his ideas, I decided that it would be good to take a look at his flagship book, Clean Code.
And so I read it.
