      I had been using a DigitalOcean droplet to host this blog and personal projects for years. But&hellip; Do I really need to spend the $6/month? It&rsquo;s just a static Hugo site, which Github pages can do for free. Game hosting on itch.io is also free, it even gives you a mechanism to embed your web games. Looks like I&rsquo;d be sorted!
Here&rsquo;s a simple CD workflow for deploying a Huge site to Github pages.

      Automated testing in gamedev Nowadays, most people agree that automated testing is absolutely crucial for all software development. Not so much when it comes to games development though. I still believe that the games industry would be able to iterate and ship faster by introducing unit and integration testing in the right places.
Godot and Gut Butch Wesley appears to be onboard, considering he created Gut, an automated testing framework for the Godot Game Engine.

      PyCon ES 2017 was an absolute blast!
The talks were very interesting and they&rsquo;re all freely available on their Youtube channel.
Celebrating PyCon ES 2017 in Caceres, located in southern Spain, was a great choice. Beautiful medieval city center where some scenes in Game of Thrones were filmed, plus cheap and delicious food.

      PyCon ES 2017, which will be running from September 22nd to September 24th in Cáceres, Spain. I&rsquo;ll be attending alongside some Bloomberg colleagues as we are one of the main sponsors of the event. If you have tickets, definitely come say hi!
I&rsquo;ll be helping out at a couple of presentations:
Bloomberg - Landing on a top Tech Tier Company Load test your backend with locust.io For those not coming, I&rsquo;m pretty sure all the talks will be recorded and made publicly available.

      JSConf EU is one of the biggest JS conferences in Europe and I was lucky enough to attend its 2017 edition earlier this month. This year the event took place in Arena Berlin, a place by the river, typically dedicated to concerts in the east side of the German capital.
Overall, it was a pretty awesome weekend and although I wish there were more talks on advanced technical topics, I understand the event is more focused on community and diversity.

      Ludum Dare 38 starts in a couple of hours. This one is special as it marks the 15th anniversary of the biggest weekend game development friendly competition in the world!
If you don&rsquo;t know about Ludum Dare and are interested, check the documentary they just released.
I was thinking of participating using Godot Engine. I have a couple of social compromises this weekend and, honestly, I am a bit scared of failing miserably, so I&rsquo;m not too sure how far I&rsquo;ll take this one.

      Two weekends ago I attended FOSDEM in Brussels for the first time and it was awesome. FOSDEM is a free conference about software development and open source with no registration required. Just show up, meet the community and learn new things.
Here are my highlights.
Planning With over 8k developers, 600 talks and 50 tracks spread across the university campus, planning is essential. Popular talks would fill up the rooms very early and the best option was to attend the previous one and get a spot in advance.

      Godot Engine caught my eye a while back as a serious open source alternative to the ubiquitous Unity. Some of you may know I&rsquo;ve been involved with the Libgdx project for some time, I even wrote a book about it!
There&rsquo;s nothing wrong with Libgdx, I absolutely love the project and the more than welcoming community around it.
The problem is that shipping a game is hard. Doing so whilst working a full time job is harder.

      At long last, I got around to do something I had been meaning to do for a very long time. I migrated this Wordpress blog over to a statically generated site powered by Hugo.
That&rsquo;s 6 years or over 300 posts worth of content.
Why not stay with Wordpress? First of all, I wanted to move away from Wordpress because it&rsquo;s heavy and requires quite a bit of setup: PHP, database, plugins and so on.

      A lot of games come with a built-in console that lets you enter commands, which is especially useful during development. Most times, it gets disabled before shipping although, occasionally, devs let you bring it up and enter cheat codes. CryEngine comes with a built-in console.
When you&quot;re testing a new feature you just wrote, it can be incredibly useful to pause, reset the scene, teleport your character, become invincible, switch to a different level or even adjust some parameters in the AI.

      In Sloppynauts the player had to remain undetected, avoiding CCTV cameras and alien baddies. We constantly had to determine who could see who and whether the player was hidden behind something. We wrote a nice reusable system using Ashley and Box2D and I think it&quot;d be a shame if it went to waste. So here it is in case you&quot;d like to use it.
This 2D vision system is generic enough to work with both side-scrolling and top-down games.

      After a crazy weekend before the deadline, we finally managed to put something playable together for LibGDXJAM.
We&quot;d love you to have a go, and leave some feedback.
We are definitely aware of the shortcomings of the game. We spent a lot of the jam working on a custom Overlap2D level loader and not so much on actual content, so you can actually finish the game in under a minute.

      Oh my God, enter panic mode, just 8 days left until the #LibGDXJAM deadline! We&rsquo;ve been hard at work, especially @DrillerDev who&rsquo;s pushed the character design and animation.
Look at this bad boy for instance, better not to mess with his alien gun.
Or the beholder powered alien surveillance.
Please, ignore the placeholder environment art, it&rsquo;s the textures from the Overlap2D example project. Our chubby astronaut can run, crouch, jump and push boxes around.

      We&quot;re halfway through the #libGDXJAM and some work has been done between Christmas and New Year&rsquo;s eve.
Here&rsquo;s a few updates.
@DrillerDev as joined us as an artist and has already produced some awesome concepts. Alberto and I have been working on an Overlap2D scene loader and it&rsquo;s pretty much working supporting a bunch of things: composites, textures, lights, physics and particles. We have a somewhat buggy physics based platformer movement system.

      Check the keynote and all the awkward moments from the dev team, including mine!
The theme is Life in Space and I&quot;m teaming up with Alberto for #libGDXJAM and here&rsquo;s our idea:
Abe&rsquo;s Oddysee meets This War of Mine meets Boogerman&hellip; in space!
A bunch of dangerously unprepared astronauts land on a strange planet only to find out it&rsquo;s inhabited by big fat angry aliens with guns. The whole crew is taken prisoner except our main character who has to rescue them all and get the hell out of that planet.

      Shortly after we moved Ashley into the Libgdx family, we started writing unit tests for every single component in the framework using jUnit.
Unit testing goodness That was over a year and a half ago and it has proven to be a huge win for many reasons.
Issue reporters can (and should) include a test that breaks as a way of explaining the problem. We can then easily include it into the suite, fix it and prevent future regressions.

      There&rsquo;s a new Ashley release, check the changes for 1.7.0 below:
API change: removed UUIDs from entities, users should implement their own ID system when needed. This helps with networked games. Update: components are added/removed immediately, listeners are notified after the current system finishes updating. Bug fix: fixed entity listeners not being called if a component is added inside another listener. Bug fix: does not allocate memory inside updateFamilyMembership(). Update: uses Libgdx 1.

      A new Ashley package has shipped, making 1.6.0 the latest stable version. Here&rsquo;s the summary of the changes:
API change: Component is now an interface. API addition: adds getEngine() to EntitySystem. API addition: EntityListeners now are notified by priority order. API consistency: defines what happens when an Entity is added twice to an Engine and when we try do nested updates. We throw an exception in both cases. API consistency: adding an EntitySystem of the same class twice replaces the previous one, just like it has always happened when adding Components to an Entity.

      As I recently mentioned, a couple of weeks ago I flew to Stockholm to attend the Intel Buzz Workshop, a conference focused on mobile games development where I preached the perks of Libgdx. The event had a great turnout and my talk seemed to have been well received. Moreover, I also got to meet cool people IRL such as Adrian, the guy behind the Artemis ECS.
For those who missed it and would like to watch me ramble about how brilliant Libgdx is for a whole 20 minutes, here is the video.

      Haven&rsquo;t bought Libgdx Cross-platform Game Development Cookbook yet? Stop reading and go get it!
Quick update to inform you that I just updated the samples repository to use Libgdx 1.6.0 and Ashley 1.5.0, both recently released.
Libgdx 1.6.0 introduces changes in our font rendering API, which require a few minor tweaks to the framework calls, nothing major.
7 months after the release of the book, we continue to support it.

      Thanks to the contributors, here&rsquo;s a new version of Ashley, which now stands at 1.5.0. A new version of your favorite component based entity framework is out.
The version comes with a bunch of bug fixes that, hopefully, will iron out some of the rough edges in Ashley.
API addition: adds getFamily() method to IntervalIteratingSystem and IteratingSystem. API change: IntervalSystem‘s update() method is now final, as it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to override it.

      For the past few weeks working on a new toy: Conjugate. It&rsquo;s probably easier if I just stick a summary of the GitHub readme here.
Conjugate is a verb conjugator service. Enter a verb in English and get the conjugations for all tenses in a variety of languages.
Reason to be When learning a new language, it is very common to struggle with verb conjugations. For example:
I want to know the third person singular form (masculine) of the future perfect tense of the verb to eat in French.
