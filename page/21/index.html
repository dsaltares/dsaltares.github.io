<p>Today Math Maze 1.0 went live on Google Play!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Woohooo!!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t know what <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.math">Math Maze</a> is, please check its <a href="../../games/math-maze/" title="Math Maze">dedicated page on this blog</a>.</p>
<p>Go, download it, share it with your friends, like the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/siondream">Facebook page</a>, <a href="../../contact/" title="Contact">drop me feedback</a> and give it some shiny stars (preferably 5 of them). You won&rsquo;t be making me rich because it&rsquo;s a free download and doesn&rsquo;t feature ads of any kind. However you might help me boost my insatiable ego… Or something like that.</p>
<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.math">Math Maze</a> shipped with 35 levels and 5 languages but will be receiving extra content shortly. 3 more languages are confirmed, I have a few level packs in mind and I&quot;ll also be fixing any issues people find. Luckily enough, it&rsquo;s behaved flawlessly, as far as I know.</p>
<p>Please do report any issues were you to find them.</p>
<p>Even though it&rsquo;s been 5 busy months of hard work after my full time job, I don&rsquo;t regret a thing. I&quot;m quite proud of what I&rsquo;ve achieved, as <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.math">Math Maze</a> looks decent and plays well even on humble devices. I guess, it&rsquo;s something considering I&quot;m just a mere programmer having to do design and art. Let&rsquo;s not forget about PR and the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mYbCyXeNJuM">trailer</a>, areas that were uncharted territory for me up until this point.</p>
<p>Cannot possibly forget to thank everyone who&rsquo;s helped me on the project: soundtrack, sound effects and localisation. <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.math">Math Maze</a> is a hell of a lot better because of them. Check the credits for more info.</p>
<p>In the upcoming days/weeks, I&quot;ll do what I can to post further details about the development process, fun facts and more bits and pieces that may remotely seem interesting to someone.</p>
<p>Escape the maze!</p>

</p>
<p>Oh my… The posting rate has dangerously decreased lately! Before you judge, know that there are a couple of very good reasons for it. First and foremost, I&quot;m on holiday, back in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cadiz">Cádiz</a>, my hometown to enjoy a little bit of sun and work on my tan. It&rsquo;s a small charming beautiful city with <a href="https://maps.google.com/maps?layer=c&amp;panoid=BoFprbNbSx0AAAQIt_2eBg&amp;cbp=1,5.0402246,,3.0,-8.579989&amp;cbll=0,0">amazing beaches</a> and prohibitively delicious places to eat .</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Fun fact</strong>: its <a href="http://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/europes-oldest-city-is-found-394505.html">3000 years of history</a> make it the oldest city in southwestern Europe. Before I took the plane, I&rsquo;ve been working hard on <a href="../../games/math-maze/" title="Math Maze">Math Maze</a>. Even though the code is stable, my pre launch stage task list was considerably big including level balancing, localisation and PR.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Marketing and PR, what a pain in the arse! Indeed. Math Maze will be a free download with zero ads as I simply want it to be played by as many people as possible. To try and get some coverage for it, I had to get a lot done: Twitter and Facebook presence, press kit, screenshots, high quality trailer and write a ton of emails. At least I&quot;m getting there.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/math-maze/trailer.png" alt="trailer.png">

</p>
<p>This <a href="http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/198381/How_to_talk_to_the_video_game_press_in_2013.php">GDC talk on reaching out to the press</a> and the <a href="http://blog.kertgartner.com/2011/09/making-the-aquaria-for-ipad-teaser-trailer/">making of the Aquaria trailer</a> for iPad are being incredibly helpful. Good thing is, I&quot;m learning so much with all this process. Some of the topics: localisation, filming a trailer and creating a press kit deserve a whole post each. Will try get to it once I&quot;m done with this. Talk soon!</p>

</p>
<p>A few months back, I was contacted by <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/">Packt Publishing</a> to see whether I was interested in being a technical reviewer for an upcoming libGDX book, to which I gladly accepted. Titled <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/learning-libgdx-game-development/book">Learning libGDX Game Development</a>, goes through all the basic features while building a multi-platform project from scratch.</p>
<p>Andreas Oelhke, author, has done what I believe to be a pretty good job, mostly thanks to the incredibly practical approach he&rsquo;s taken. I&rsquo;ve read many game programming books that explain in depth how a given technology works, but don&rsquo;t teach the newcomer how to put everything together. Oh boy, I remember that feeling! Even though, it requires some basic games and Java knowledge, the reader will feel his hand held by the explanations at all times.</p>
<p>The book hits the reader towards deeper and more complex topics to expand on, which makes it an excellent starting point. It&rsquo;s not rare to encounter people in the forums asking too general questions because they don&rsquo;t know how to get something going and I believe this could fill the gap.</p>
<p>As I&quot;m not the author, I feel quite comfortable speaking highly about it. Learning libGDX Game Development is coming out this September, so make sure to check that out. Regardless of my little involvement, I&quot;m actually quite excited about it!</p>

<p>Math Maze is what&rsquo;s been keeping me busy after work for the past three months and now it&rsquo;s dangerously approaching a state I&quot;m happy with. Woohooo!</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Is your head agile enough to succeed at this math based brain teaser game? Reach the exit of the labyrinth as fast as you can by using operations that will open the conditional blockages. Freshen up your mental calculus without even realising!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I just wanted to make a really simple Android game so as to be able to polish it without giving up my job nor my social life. Then I came across with this <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-26/?action=preview&amp;uid=4628">Ludum Dare game</a> and loved the concept. Reduced scope, perfect for short play sessions on a mobile device and an interesting educational flavour that convinced me to target kids.</p>
<p>Last week I launched a closed alpha through Google Play and Google Plus. Involving relatives and friends as soon as I could has proven to be of huge help. The alpha resulted in very positive feedback and loads of design suggestions which are going to help me make a better game. Also a couple of bugs were found, so I would expect the final version to be pretty solid. Actually, I even put together a questionnaire and may even publish some of the conclusions I got from it.</p>
<p>All they say about how important is early external playtesting is true. Do it.</p>
<p>So far it&rsquo;s been excellent. Math Maze is coming together nicely and I&quot;m learning loads about libgdx, user experience for kids and general game development. Don&rsquo;t take me wrong, it&rsquo;s a tiny game, but I&quot;m humbly happy with it. If I could focus on some PR towards launch, that&quot;d be just fantastic.</p>

</p>
<p>Last week I went to <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/search?safe=off&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=develop%20brighton&amp;oq=&amp;gs_l=&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_cp.r_qf.&amp;bvm=bv.48705608,d.d2k&amp;biw=1097&amp;bih=541&amp;ion=1&amp;pf=p&amp;pdl=300&amp;emsg=NCSR&amp;noj=1&amp;ei=HXnkUbHZBqe_0QXKroHYAw">Develop in Brighton</a> with work, had a great time and attended talks full of insight, so lucky me! While that might very well be a whole post on its own, I want to focus on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Sweeney_(game_developer)">Tim Sweeney</a>&ldquo;s interview on the past and future of Unreal Engine and Epic Games. More specifically, on the fact that they&quot;ll be dropping their widely used <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UnrealScript">scripting language</a> entirely towards Unreal 4. Programmers will work exclusively with C++.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Hang on, what?! I&rsquo;ve been trying so hard to master it cause I heard it&quot;d get me a job in the industry… Now what?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That&rsquo;s exactly my point.</p>
<p>So many people, mostly games students, tend to focus way too much on proprietary technologies arguing a high demand for them within the industry. Today, the cool kid in the block is mostly Unity but Unreal also gets a piece of the cake. As much as that may be true at this point in time, it&rsquo;s a very dangerous long term investment. Please be aware that my argument doesn&rsquo;t apply if you&quot;re all about the fun of making games. If so, by all means, use whatever makes you happy.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t get me wrong, learning a cool engine is always useful. Quick prototyping and discovering real life workflows are, indeed, great perks. Nevertheless, restricting yourself can backfire big time. Those who didn&rsquo;t become good enough at C++ while they were playing around with the Unity scene editor, will have a much harder time getting a job once the company behind their fancy engine goes bankrupt or simply stops being popular.</p>
<p>As long as you&quot;re fluent using common data structures, know how a computer memory works, understand the concepts behind algorithmic complexity (big O) and are able to write clean, fast C++ code you&quot;ll be absolutely fine. Those skills are a must have in the games industry and even more so in AAA territory.</p>
<p>Are you comfortable with pointers? What about bit shifting? Avoiding string compares? Preventing memory leaks?</p>
<blockquote>
<p>But loads of small and medium sized companies use Unity!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Companies want you to adapt quickly to their way of doing things and you&quot;ll become a much more versatile programmer by being decent at a low level language. Switching from C++ to C# is relatively easy while the opposite can quickly become an awful nightmare. Hey, you can always prove you&quot;re an amazingly fast learner by adding a scripting based project to your portfolio.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t let modern shininess blind you. C++ will continue to be the most widely used language for games programming in the foreseeable future. Cool stuff will show up, but it might not be there tomorrow, don&rsquo;t bet everything on the same runner.</p>
