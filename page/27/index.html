<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sum total of every expressive media of all times made interactive, how is that not awesome!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently watched with a few friends <strong><a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game: The Movie</a></strong>, a documentary that shows the development process of a few independent small budget games and what drives their authors to work in such a competitive industry. I was fairly excited about watching it since the trailer highlighted <strong>some of the reasons I chose this career path</strong>. However, bare in mind that all that glitters is not gold.</p>
<p>Indie Game features three well known independent games being <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat Boy</a>, <a href="http://braid-game.com/">Braid</a> and <a href="http://fezgame.com/">Fez</a>. Their developers have proven themselves to be <strong>talented, creative people</strong> who took a ridiculously huge risk in order to do what they&quot;re truly passionate about: video games. That is definitely worth respect. However, I feel the necessity to point out the fact that not every game developer in the world is as those shown in the documentary.</p>
<p>They are generally normal, <strong>non tormented</strong>, cheerful people who don&rsquo;t have problems to socialize over a couple of beers. Most of them, actually, love beer. It&rsquo;s important to remark the line between medium/big studios where the mere commoners do not take the financial risk and the two people company who basically bet their future on its success. I&quot;d also be pretty stressed about it. Indie Game: The Movie is exclusively about the latter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good about this film is how <strong>it shows the passion and love</strong> these developers feel about what they do. You learn that, despite all the extenuating and brain melting crunching hours, the outcome of people having fun and experiencing all kinds of feelings with something you&rsquo;ve created is amazing. Of course there&rsquo;s also some people who like to play the misunderstood bohemian artist role, if you saw it already, you know what I&quot;m talking about [cough] Braid! [/cough].</p>
<p>Forget about my negative comments, Indie Game: The Movie is definitely worth a watch for several reasons. To know more about the making of a video game and to understand why their authors are so excited about them could be two good examples. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s very well put together, reasonably cheap ($10), comes completely DRM free, allows streaming, 1080p download version and includes subtitles.</p>

<p>A few months ago I developed <a href="../../games/urban-race/">Urban Race</a>, a very simple (and quite lame) time attack racing game using XNA. It was a University project so I couldn&rsquo;t release the source until it was graded but then, I totally forgot about it. Recently, a reader asked me to publish the source and here we are. Please, bare in mind it&rsquo;s for educational purposes, it was developed in one month without previous knowledge of neither C# or XNA and it&rsquo;s not intended to be a fully playable product.</p>
<ul>

<li><a href="http://urban-race.googlecode.com/files/urbanrace-essay.pdf">Urban Race essay (documentation)</a></li>
<li><a href="http://urban-race.googlecode.com/files/urbanrace-1.0-win.zip">Urban Race 1.0 for Windows</a></li>
</ul>
<p>I usually document my projects with Doxygen and several articles or tutorials, this time has been different. At least I&rsquo;ve uploaded a PDF file with the documentation I submitted for my project to be graded. You&quot;ll have to excuse me for lack of further and more accessible documentation but I don&rsquo;t have much time now and, prior to this moment, I didn&rsquo;t think this game was worth making public.</p>
<p>Anyways, you can freely access the source, reuse components and re-share.

      <a class="label" href="../../categories/games-development">Games development</a>
      </span>
      
      <p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Warning</span></strong>: Libgdx now counts with <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/wiki/Internationalization-and-Localization">localisation support</a>, rendering this approach obsolete.</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">Edit</span>:</strong> I just added UTF-8 support</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://www.altdevblogaday.com/2012/04/19/localization-notes/">Localization is a key aspect in games</a></strong>, specially if you want to reach a wider audience. I recently <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/freegemas-gdx">ported Freegemas</a> to the libgdx platform and, as the original one, I wanted to ship it with multi-language support. There is no such a thing as <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/">gettext</a> for Java and I didn&rsquo;t see the Android internationalization system as a good fit in a multiplatform development. That&rsquo;s why I developed my little own internationalization module.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/freegemas-gdx/blob/master/freegemas/src/com/siondream/freegemas/LanguagesManager.java">Download LanguagesManager.java</a></strong></p>
<p>Its usage is extremely simple, first we need a <em>media/languages.xml</em> file where all the strings in our project will be located. The syntax is pretty straight forward, we lay language sections identified with the code for each language. Inside every language, we provide a list of key value pairs with the localized strings.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt; ?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;languages&gt;

   &lt;language name=&quot;en_UK&quot; &gt;

      &lt;string key=&quot;Timetrial mode&quot; value=&quot;Timetrial mode&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;string key=&quot;How to play&quot; value=&quot;How to play&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;string key=&quot;Exit&quot; value=&quot;Exit&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/language&gt;


   &lt;language name=&quot;es_ES&quot; &gt;

      &lt;string key=&quot;Timetrial mode&quot; value=&quot;Contrarreloj&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;string key=&quot;How to play&quot; value=&quot;Ayuda&quot; /&gt;
      &lt;string key=&quot;Exit&quot; value=&quot;Salir&quot; /&gt;
   &lt;/language&gt;
&lt;/languages&gt;
</code></pre><p>We can retrieve localized strings in our project through the <em>LanguagesManager</em> class and its <em>getString()</em> method. It&rsquo;s been implemented using the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singleton_pattern">Singleton</a> design pattern as we only need one instance accessible from, potentially, everywhere in the code. When we ask our manager for a certain string we will use its key, if it finds it within the current language, it&quot;ll return it, otherwise it&quot;ll return the key itself. That&rsquo;s why using strings in a base language (English) as keys can be a good idea, those will be returned by default.</p>
<p>For now, it uses <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lazy_initialization">lazy initialization</a> which means it&quot;ll load the language the first time the <em>getInstance()</em> method is called but that might change in the future. It automatically detects the system language (no matter if we are on Android or a desktop environment) and it fallsback to English if the system language is not among the available ones in the <em>data/languages.xml</em> file. However, you can explicitly specify the language you want to load through the <em>loadLanguage()</em> method.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>LanguagesManager lang;

lang = LanguagesManager.getInstance();

String option1 = lang.getString(&quot;Timetrial mode&quot;);
String option2 = lang.getString(&quot;How to play&quot;);
String option3 = lang.getString(&quot;Exit&quot;);
</code></pre><p>Freegemas libgdx is open source (<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/quick-guide-gplv3.html">GPL v3</a>) as is this internationalization module which means you&quot;re more than welcome to download it, use it and improve it. If you do the latest, make sure you distribute it the same way as me.</p>

<p>I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been almost three months since I started at Crytek UK, time has passed amazingly fast! Nevertheless, I&rsquo;ve managed to get some stuff done game development wise. I&rsquo;ve always wanted to jump into mobile and that&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been doing during the last couple of weeks. <strong>May I present you <a href="../../games/freegemas-for-android-and-html5/">Freegemas libgdx</a> edition!</strong></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s basically a libgdx port of the original Freegemas, a simple Bejeweled like C++ Gosu puzzle game developed by <a href="http://josetomastocino.com/">José Tomás Tocino</a> who I have to thank for the neat original code and the excellent art. This means you can run it on your <a href="http://freegemas-libgdx.googlecode.com/files/freegemas-1.0.jar">desktop</a>, <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.siondream.freegemas">Android phone</a> and very soon on your browser through HTML5 sweetness.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/freegemas/freegemas-02.png" alt="freegemas"></p>
<p><strong><a href="http://code.google.com/p/libgdx/">Libgdx</a></strong> it&rsquo;s an open source Java library that allows you to create multiplatform games (desktop, Android, HTML5) sharing the <strong>same code base</strong>. That alone is amazing enough, so kudos to <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/wordpress">Mario</a> for the titanic work. The library uses OpenGL so the performance it&rsquo;s quite good even though we&quot;re talking about Java! It has so many features and associated tools that it&quot;d take me a few days to cover them all. Plus the community is always very helpful, besides the forums there&rsquo;s always someone on the IRC channel willing to save your ass. However, to be honest it&rsquo;s a bit of a downside to me it&rsquo;s lack of UFT-8 font rendering support. Maybe some other day I&quot;ll talk with some more insight about libgdx.</p>
<p>This was a warm up project, bigger things are yet to come!</p>
<p>PS: I must not forget about the HTML5 version of the game, it&quot;ll be available soon.</p>

<p>I can finally say it out loud: <strong>I just got hired by Crytek UK as a junior programmer!</strong> In case you were wondering, yes, they are the same guys that pulled the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PHOCJR1S7cQ">Crysis</a> saga together using their jaw dropping <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VJEL9Kipuw4">CryEngine</a>, and now they&quot;re working on games like Homefront 2. Their British studio is based in Nottingham, so I moved here a couple of days ago and I really like the city so far.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/nottingham-lace-market.jpg" alt="nottingham-lace-market.jpg"></p>
<p>This is, without any doubts, a dream job and I couldn&rsquo;t be happier about it, it&rsquo;s what I&rsquo;ve been aiming for since I started University. I couldn&rsquo;t possibly have predicted this would happen a few months ago. Maybe a little mobile games company crossed my mind, but a huge triple A company like Crytek? No way. As you can see, the office is quite amazing and the people here are most thoughtful and friendly.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/crytek-uk-building.jpg" alt="crytek-uk-building.jpg"></p>
<p>I&quot;d like to thank everyone who&rsquo;s helped me from professors to team mates without forgetting about family and friends. A new life full of changes and exciting experiences lies ahead! I&quot;ll try to update the blog as often as I can. Of course I&quot;ll post personal games reviews, game design and games programming articles.</p>
