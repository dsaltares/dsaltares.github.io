      <span class="post-date">Nov 7, 2012 &middot; 3 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/games/gleed2d-level-loading-system-for-libgdx/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="../../categories/games-development">Games development</a>
      </span>
      
      <p><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Update</strong></span>: the system had been <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/extensions/gdx-gleed">moved into the official libgdx repository</a> as an extension but then it was removed. Gleed doesn&rsquo;t support basic features such as relative paths for textures.</p>
<p>I&quot;m happy to announce that I&rsquo;ve made my first contribution to a relatively big open source project. I feel honoured to contribute to the brilliant <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx">libgdx framework</a> with these humble loader and renderer for GLEED2D levels. Hold on, what the hell is that? Please, read on.</p>
<h3 id="about-gleed">About GLEED</h3>
<p><a href="http://gleed2d.codeplex.com/">GLEED2D</a> is a non tiled based open source general purpose level editor. You can place textures and shapes, rotate and scale them. As usual, elements are laid in layers and it is also possible to add custom properties which makes it adequate for all kinds of purposes. Level are saved in an easy to parse XML format. It&rsquo;s based on XNA 3 but XNA 4 and Mono versions are on the works. What&rsquo;s good aboutGLEED2D is that it allows you to create smooth levels in a very nice way. Shapes can be used to define collision areas, triggers and so on.</p>
<p>This means you can set a few rules and conventions of your own and be able to fire up scripts, set the player spawn point and all sorts of level design sweetness.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/gleed-editor.png" alt="gleed-editor.png">

</p>
<h3 id="features">Features</h3>
<ul>
<li>Full XML GLEED2D spec: layers, custom properties, textures, shapes (circle, rectangle, polygon), visibility, color tints…</li>
<li>Transforms: object positioning, rotation and scaling.</li>
<li>LevelRenderer class with frustum culling</li>
<li>AssetManager integration through the LevelLoader class</li>
<li>Use multiple Texture files or a single TextureAtlas for performance gain.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="possible-improvements">Possible improvements</h3>
<ul>
<li>Make the renderer use a SpriteCache (tricky due to texture rotation)</li>
<li>Create a JSON exporter and loader for performance gain</li>
<li>Load levels without using the AssetManager? Some people don&rsquo;t use it but they really should since levels tend to be heavy to load</li>
<li>Suggest more!</li>
</ul>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/gleed-level-ingame.jpg" alt="gleed-level-ingame.jpg">

</p>
<h3 id="usage">Usage</h3>
<p>When creating the level you need to specify the textures root folder or atlas file as a top level custom property:</p>
<ul>
<li>If using individual textures create the &ldquo;assetRoot&rdquo; property</li>
<li>If using an atlas create the &ldquo;atlas&rdquo; property</li>
</ul>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Set loader in the Asset manager
m_assetManager.setLoader(Level.class, new LevelLoader(new InternalFileHandleResolver()));

...

// Tell the manager to load the level
m_assetManager.load(&#34;data/braidtest.xml&#34;, Level.class);

...

// When it&#39;s ready, fetch the level and create renderer
m_level = m_assetManager.get(&#34;data/braidtest.xml&#34;, Level.class);
m_levelRenderer = new LevelRenderer(m_level, null, Game.mpp);

...

// Render all layers
m_levelRenderer.render(m_camera);
</code></pre><p>However, if you get lost, there are Javadoc comments <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/sionengine/tree/master/sionengine/src/com/siondream/engine/gleed">everywhere in the code</a>.</p>
<h3 id="where-do-i-get-it">Where do I get it?</h3>
<p>It should be soon in the <a href="libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/">libgdx nightly builds</a> but if you&quot;re really eager to use it and can&rsquo;t wait any longer (seriously?) you can go to the libgdx repository and find it in the <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/master/extensions/gdx-gleed">extensions section</a>. Remember to leave some feedback of any flavour: rotten tomatoes, rocks and so on and so forth.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been a busy bee lately but here it comes yet another post with a piece of not so relevant news related to my projects.</p>
<p>Even though I&rsquo;ve always been kind of sceptical about GitHub, I&rsquo;ve finally decided to migrate most of my projects. After getting a bit deeper into the libgdx community over there, I&rsquo;ve come to see the benefits of this self proclaimed social coding platform. Forking, pulling and giving/receiving feedback is easy and motivating (kind of a must when working on side projects). This way I&quot;ll also force myself to use Git, which is full of love and we&quot;re here to learn aren&rsquo;t we?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve successfully exported the following projects, now available from my <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares">profile</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/glapse">gLapse</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/urbanrace">Urban Race</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/freegemas-gdx">Freegemas gdx</a></li>
</ul>
<p>In order to carry out the migration whilst keeping the full commit history I&rsquo;ve used <a href="https://github.com/nirvdrum/svn2git">svn2git</a>. It&rsquo;s just a ridiculously easy to use Ruby script built upon the git svn tool. I could write a post on how to do it, but it&quot;d be pointless since it&rsquo;s very well detailed in the project&rsquo;s readme.</p>
<p>Expect updates soonish!</p>

<p>Ludum Dare #24 voting round is over and <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/ludum-dare-24/?action=preview&amp;uid=3661"><strong>Evolution – The Survival of the fittest</strong></a> did… Okey. To be honest, this doesn’t come as a surprise at all if you look at the <a href="../../games/ld24-evolution-postmortem/">postmortem</a> I posted right after the jam ended. Here are the results for my entry.</p>
<ul>
<li>Graphics: 3.84 #87</li>
<li>Humor: 2.62 #201</li>
<li>Audio: 2.68 #272</li>
<li>Mood: 2.67 #352</li>
<li>Theme: 2.63 #469</li>

<li>Overall: 2.45 #628</li>
<li>Coolness: 40% #719</li>
<li>Innovation: 1.56 #755</li>
</ul>
<p>I’m happy to have done well in graphics because I put a lot of effort into making something visually appealing, I obviously wasted too much time on that though, people didn’t like how it played. My lowest score actually goes to the Fun category… <strong>What’s the point of making games if they’re not fun to play?</strong> I most definitely will try to learn the lesson towards my next take on Ludum Dare and future projects. After all, it’s all about learning, isn’t it?</p>
<p>On the other side, I was a Ludum Dare virgin until now and ending up in the #620 is not a complete disaster taking into account that there were 1406 submissions.</p>
<p>Anyways, it could have gone better but I’m fairly satisfied. <strong>Next time I will aim for a much better submission</strong>.</p>

<p><strong>Disclaimer</strong>: IDGenerator is being used in <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/sionengine"><strong>SionEngine</strong></a> and it&rsquo;s an useful but rather simple approach to the problem described in the paragraphs below.</p>
<p>Needless to say that <strong>in games development we care very much about performance</strong>. It becomes an even more critical issue when we&quot;re dealing with non native languages such as Python, C# or Java (being the later my case in these dire times). One of the countless things that can negatively impact performance in games are strings comparisons. They are bad, slow, nasty pieces of code, specially when placed inside the main loop.</p>
<h3 id="sometimes-theyre-needed">Sometimes they&quot;re needed!</h3>
<p>But sometimes they&quot;re needed! A little person shouts in the crowd. Let&rsquo;s say we define our character&rsquo;s animations in an XML file the following way.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>&lt;?xml version=&#34;1.0&#34; encoding=&#34;UTF-8&#34;?&gt;
&lt;sprite name=&#34;data/character.png&#34;
	      frameDuration=&#34;0.03333&#34;
	      rows=&#34;7&#34;
	      columns=&#34;8&#34; &gt;

	&lt;animation name=&#34;idle&#34; mode=&#34;loop&#34; frames=&#34;0-13&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;animation name=&#34;walk&#34; mode=&#34;loop&#34; frames=&#34;14-39&#34; /&gt;
	&lt;animation name=&#34;jump&#34; mode=&#34;normal&#34; frames=&#34;40-55&#34; /&gt;
&lt;/sprite&gt;
</code></pre><p>It&rsquo;s natural to use strings to name our animations, they&quot;re human readable and comfy but again, expensive to work with. Our character will want to change animation from time to time and the code for that could be something like:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>caveman.setAnimation(&#34;walk&#34;);
</code></pre><p>The <em>setAnimation()</em> method has to look into its map, performing <em>log(n)</em> ugly string comparisons to find the right animation. We&quot;re righteous game programmers and that makes us sad.</p>
<h3 id="working-our-way-around-string-comparisons">Working our way around string comparisons</h3>
<p>Well, in that case we&quot;d want to use an alternative method. It&quot;d be nice to be able to numerically identify a string in the global scope of our game, so when we have two generated IDs we could just compare them. That&rsquo;s very cheap, yay! ID generation and retrieval might not be lightning fast but that would only be performed during start up or once in a while, definitely not in the very middle of our game loop.</p>
<p>The first approach that someone might come up with are <strong><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function">hashes</a></strong> which basically turn a string into a number. The problem being: if the string is fairly big and you&quot;re unlucky, you may end up having the same hash code for two different strings and you don&rsquo;t want that, do you? Pretty sure some funny to hunt bug will be the result of such thing.</p>
<p>We are most definitely not going to use all the infinite strings in the world so we could <strong>generate new IDs for them as they&quot;re needed</strong>. Obviously, when we find two IDs generated from the same string, we&quot;d like them to be equal. Our solution would have to keep track of the strings that have already been identified and return the same ID when it&rsquo;s requested again. Easy peasy.</p>
<h3 id="a-simple-but-decent-solution-_idgenerator_">A simple but decent solution: <em>IDGenerator</em></h3>
<p>This might not be the most intelligent implementation for the present problem, however it certainly serves the purpose of the post. Our IDGenerator has two static public methods:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><em>getID()</em></strong>: given a string, returns its ID. Creates a new one if it didn&rsquo;t exist. * <em><strong>getString()</strong></em>: given an ID, return its original string. Returns the string representation of the ID if it wasn&rsquo;t registered.</li>
</ul>
<p>To do so, it has a <em>HashMap</em> using strings as keys. ID retrieval ends up being logarithmic whereas name checks are linear. I&rsquo;ve gone for this approach because the second operation is much less likely to be executed than the first one except to make IDs human readable for the poor coder who&rsquo;s debugging our crappy work in logging methods.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the <em>&ldquo;beauty&rdquo;</em> in question.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class IDGenerator {
	private static int m_next = 1;
	private static HashMap&lt;string , Integer&gt; m_ids = new HashMap&lt;string , Integer&gt;();

	public static int getID(String string) {
		Integer id = m_ids.get(string);

		if (id == null) {
			id = m_next;
			m_ids.put(string, m_next++);
		}

		return id;
	}

	public static String getString(int id) {
		Iterator&lt;entry &lt;String, Integer&gt;&gt; it = m_ids.entrySet().iterator();

		while (it.hasNext()) {
			Entry&lt;string , Integer&gt; entry = it.next();

			if (entry.getValue() == id) {
				return entry.getKey();
			}
		}

		return null;
	}
}
</code></pre><h3 id="example-of-use">Example of use</h3>
<p>Sticking to our previous animation example, our character could cache its animations right in its constructor this way. <strong>Once!</strong></p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>private static final int m_idle = IDGenerator.getID(&#34;idle&#34;);
private static final int m_walk = IDGenerator.getID(&#34;walk&#34;);
private static final int m_jump = IDGenerator.getID(&#34;jump&#34;);
</code></pre><p>Now, at the time of picking an animation we use an int instead of a string and therefore, a beautiful smile is drawn on our faces.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>caveman.setAnimation(m_walk);
</code></pre><p>Of course, this can be extensively use in your project, hope it helps. By the way, know than more and hopefully better is yet to come.</p>

        <a href="https://saltares.com/games/abstracting-platform-specific-code-in-libgdx/">Abstracting platform specific code in libgdx</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sep 8, 2012 &middot; 3 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/games/abstracting-platform-specific-code-in-libgdx/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="../../categories/games-development">Games development</a>
      </span>
      
      <p>One of the main reasons I&quot;m working with <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a> is its multiplatform capabilities. With very little effort you can target desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Android and WebGL able browsers. The problem comes with the <em>&ldquo;little&rdquo;</em> in the previous sentence. The developer is supposed to share the code base between all targets but sometimes it&quot;s necessary to provide platform specific behaviour, maybe because a feature is not available in every device or just to adapt the product better to the target. Anyway, how do we achieve that in a fairly elegant fashion?</p>
<h3 id="project-structure">Project structure</h3>
<p>As many of you may already know, a multiplatform libgdx project is often arranged the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>game</strong>: shared code base</li>
<li><strong>game-desktop</strong>: desktop launcher</li>
<li><strong>game-android</strong>: Android launcher</li>
<li><strong>game-html</strong>: HTML5 launcher</li>
</ul>
<p>Every platform specific project depends on the base one and they all instantiate the main class from there, typically belonging to an <code>ApplicationListener</code> derived class (we shall name it <em>Game</em> from now on). Yes, it is perfectly fine to add platform specific code in the derived projects. However, it would be desirable to handle platform specific behaviour using an homogeneous approach, from our base project.</p>
<h3 id="the-platformresolver-interface">The PlatformResolver interface</h3>
<p>This interface belongs to the shared code base and it contains methods to provide platform specific behaviour depending on our needs. Here there&quot;s just a very basic example but this interface could vary on a per game basis. A good idea would be to implement this class as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">Facade</a> providing access to platform specific subsystems such as input management or Facebook connectivity to mention a couple.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public interface PlatformResolver {
    public String getDefaultLanguage();
    public FacebookAPI getFacebookAPI();
    public InputManager getInputManager();
}
</code></pre><p>Our main game class would hold an instance to a specific <em>PlatformResolver</em> yet to be determined. It&quot;s each platform&quot;s responsibility to tell the game which instance should it use to solve platform specific issues.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class Game implements ApplicationListener {
    protected static PlatformResolver m_platformResolver = null;

    public static PlatformResolver getPlatformResolver() {
        return m_platformResolver;
    }

    public static void setPlatformResolver(PlatformResolver platformResolver) {
        m_platformResolver = platformResolver;
    }
}
</code></pre><h3 id="platformresolver-in-use">PlatformResolver in use</h3>
<p>In each descendent project we would have something similar to:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class AndroidResolver implements PlatformResolver {}
public class DesktopResolver implements PlatformResolver {}
public class WebGLResolver implements PlatformResolver {}
</code></pre><p>Like I mentioned before, it&quot;s necessary to tell the <em>Game</em> which platform resolver to use, we do that in every platform&quot;s launcher. The desktop one could serve as a perfectly valid example:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Configure platform dependent code
    Game.setPlatformResolver(new DesktopResolver());

    // Launch the game
    new LwjglApplication(new Game(), cfg);
}
</code></pre><p>Later on during execution we could need to determine the system&quot;s default language but that depends on the platform we are working with… Fear no more! We can happily ask our <em>PlatformResolver</em>:</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>String defaultLang = Game.getPlatformResolver().getDefaultLanguage();
</code></pre><h3 id="the-possibilities">The possibilities</h3>
<p>We are currently using this very same approach for <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/sionengine">SionEngine</a> and it&quot;s proven to be flawless so far. You can abstract virtually any platform specific behaviour using something similar.</p>
<p>Soon there will be more and better on libgdx related stuff! Feel free to criticize and throw rocks at me because of this post.</p>
