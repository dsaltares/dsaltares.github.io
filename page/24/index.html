      </span>
      
      <p>It&rsquo;s February already! What kind of madness is this? Anyhow, that means it&rsquo;s time to start working on this month&rsquo;s entry for <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One Game A Month</a> without further ado. This time I promise not to shamelessly make a port of an existing game and go for a brand new project instead. Shall this initial design article serve as the compromise I&quot;m making to see this game to completion.</p>
<p>I believe the following game concept to be simple enough for it to be achievable within a short month like February. Understandably, mechanics are very likely to change in case they don&rsquo;t work as initially thought. However I&rsquo;ve tried to keep the idea to it&rsquo;s bare minimum. Also, additional features will be included if there&rsquo;s a necessity and enough time for them.</p>
<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The humans have invaded the planet you call home! All of a sudden there are all these conquest hungry astronauts wandering around. You must take your recon spaceship and abduct them all before it&rsquo;s too late!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/design-anotated.png" alt="design-anotated.png"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you control an alien in a small spaceship who must abduct every astronaut in each level in the minimum amount of time possible. In order to do so, you must position the ship over them for a certain amount of time, while the alien halo drags them up. Beware the rocky environment, you don&rsquo;t want to crash in the middle of the mission!</p>
<p>Level design would start quite simple with linear levels that test the player&rsquo;s skill controlling the spaceship. However, as the game progresses, things might get complicated. What seems to be a linear level could actually be some sort of maze with hidden astronauts requiring exploration.</p>
<h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
<p>The player uses touch controls to pilot the spaceship across the level. Rather than using an unpopular virtual joystick, he&rsquo;s presented area controls. The steering force applied to the spaceship will be different depending on the touch position: up, left or right. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that by touching the intersections, the player can make the ship ascend whilst moving towards a side.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/design-controls.png" alt="design-controls.png"></p>
<p>Piloting the spaceship has the additional difficulty of having to take into account inertia. If we let it descend for a while, it&quot;ll be quite hard to regain height. On the contrary, if we ascend too much, we&quot;ll inevitably crash as well.</p>
<h3 id="visuals">Visuals</h3>
<p>As explained in <a href="../../general/2d-character-creation-and-animation-for-dummies/"><em>&ldquo;2D character creation and animation… For dummies&rdquo;</em></a>, my lack of skill kind of forces me to go for a friendly cartoon style. No worries, that&rsquo;s fine because it matches the gameplay. It&rsquo;s clearly a casual arcade game with funny characters, so some colorful vector art will come very in handy.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>LibGDX will be the framework of choice and I&quot;ll try to keep the code as cross platform compatible as possible with the aim of targeting desktop, Android and HTML5. I&quot;ll be regularly posting updates!</p>

        <a href="https://saltares.com/games/beware-memory-allocation/">Beware memory allocation</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 29, 2013 &middot; 7 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/games/beware-memory-allocation/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="../../categories/games-development">Games development</a>
      </span>
      
      <p>I bet you already know that keeping memory allocation under control in real time applications is absolutely essential. Bad memory management in non <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage collected languages</a>, say C++, results in irresponsible footprints. $deity forbid we incur in a std::bad_alloc exception! That can be a deal breaker for mobile phones or consoles. However, the other family of languages is what really haunts me. In Java, for instance, the consequences of not giving a monkey&rsquo;s about memory won&rsquo;t necessarily make your game crash. Nonetheless, it can be silently devastating to the point of dragging your frame rate below ground absent previous notice.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want that now, do you?</p>
<p>Please, let me take a step back and point out the irony of having to be extremely careful with memory usage in the presence of a garbage collector (GC) when dealing with real time problems. It&rsquo;s often said that it takes the responsibility off you. In a beautiful world where code tastes like lollipop it would, but this is really not the case. At least not entirely.</p>
<p>This article is aimed at developers who code in GC environments to make real time applications. Concepts here also apply to broader fields in spite of the focus mainly being Java and games development using the libgdx framework. Actually, I decided to write this post after seeing the same performance related questions <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=3572">over</a> and <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=6785&amp;hilit=performance+garbage">over</a> again in the libgdx forums. Most of them are closely tied to memory allocation.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/garbage-collector-strikes-back.jpg" alt="garbage-collector-strikes-back.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="be-aware-of-the-gc-and-why-its-critical-in-mobileconsoles">Be aware of the GC and why it&rsquo;s critical in mobile/consoles</h3>
<p>The GC is fired up every now and then and asks: <em>&ldquo;what objects are currently not being referenced by any variable?&quot;</em>. The next step is freeing the memory those objects were occupying so it becomes available for other purposes. It keeps the playground clean and neat and that&rsquo;s awesome to some extent. Surely enough, this might not cause too much trouble in classic applications. However, it can be deadly in a situation where you have less than 1/60s to compute a discrete simulation step.</p>
<p>Note: I just told a white lie. JVM&rsquo;s GC actually follows several strategies to free up unused memory as pointed out in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582209/java-garbage-collector-when-does-it-collect">this Stack Overflow post</a>.</p>
<p>A common mistake, which I&rsquo;ve made myself with <a href="../../freegemas/">Freegemas</a>, is to believe my game is well optimized because it runs flawlessly on an i7 machine. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself, go on and deploy your libgdx app on a mid tier Android phone and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh well… This is disappointing…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mobile devices and consoles typically fall short on memory. You miss those 16GB of RAM, don&rsquo;t you? Moreover, every time the GC decides to intervene, the stall becomes more noticeable due to the less powerful CPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh noes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long story short, we need to prevent this from happening as much as we possibly can.</p>
<h3 id="cache-temporal-variables-as-data-members">Cache temporal variables as data members</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that some memory allocation is needed. Don&rsquo;t worry about loading your assets at sensible times as well as creating game objects to get things ready. Nevertheless, avoid making use of the new operator inside your game loop at any cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I do need some auxiliary, yet costly, objects to perform calculations every frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worry no more as you can make them private data members. As cheeky as it may sound, this will spare you a fair amount of problems.</p>
<p>I&quot;m currently working on a GLEED level system refactor and I think the renderer class could serve us as an perfect example. I use two Rectangle objects (Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes) to perform frustum culling: the first one represents the camera while the second one corresponds to the texture we might or might not render. Those two Rectangle objects don&rsquo;t naturally belong to the GLEEDMapRenderer themselves, but why would I allocate memory for new instances every single frame. That&quot;d make the GC sad. Instead, take a look at this simplified snippet.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class GleedMapRenderer implements MapRenderer, Disposable {

	// Renderer data
	private GleedMap m_map;
	private SpriteBatch m_batch;
	private boolean m_ownSpriteBatch;
	private float m_mpp;

	// Aux data for fustrum culling
	private Rectangle m_box = new Rectangle();
	private Rectangle m_camera = new Rectangle();

	public void render(OrthographicCamera camera) {
		m_camera.x = camera.position.x - camera.viewportWidth * 0.5f * camera.zoom;
		m_camera.y = camera.position.y - camera.viewportHeight * 0.5f * camera.zoom;
		m_camera.width = camera.viewportWidth *  camera.zoom;
		m_camera.height = camera.viewportHeight *  camera.zoom;

		setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);

		MapLayers layers = m_map.getLayers();

		for (MapLayer layer : layers) {
			renderLayer(layer);
		}
	}

	private void renderLayer(MapLayer layer) {

		if (!layer.getVisible()) {
			return;
		}

		MapObjects objects = layer.getObjects();
		int numObjects = objects.getNumObjects();

		for (int j = 0; j &lt; numObjects; ++j) {
			MapObject mapObject = objects.getObject(j);

			if (mapObject == null || !mapObject.getVisible()) {
				continue;
			}

			if (!(mapObject instanceof TextureMapObject)) {
				continue;
			}

			TextureMapObject texture = (TextureMapObject)mapObject;

			setBounds(texture);

			// If the image is in the frustum, draw it (culling)
			if (m_camera.overlaps(m_box) ||
			    m_camera.contains(m_box) ||
			    m_box.contains(m_camera)) {

				...
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre><p>As illustrated above, the Rectangle instances are created along the renderer and properly set every frame. Consequently, what initially would have involved memory allocations, assignments and GC activity is reduced to just a few unavoidable assignments. Let&rsquo;s mention it once again, in spite of rectangles being cheap, you don&rsquo;t want to mess with the GC on mobile devices!</p>
<h3 id="consider-object-pooling">Consider object pooling</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, at some point you will find yourself in the need of constantly creating dozens of big sized objects. It&rsquo;s a common problem when dealing with spawning game entities, particle effects and the like. Say you&quot;re making a space shooter, of course you want hundreds of flashy explosions and lasers! You&quot;ll face a problem, that can drive the GC crazy as particles pop up or disappear.</p>
<p>Attention! The object pool game programming design pattern is on its way to rescue the programmer in distress!</p>
<p>I&quot;d encourage you to read through <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html">this wonderful article</a> to get to know this common pattern. In brief, we basically keep a collection of pre-created objects (pool) that will be retrieved as necessary. We could have a pool with 1000 particle effects, every time we need an explosion in our game we just ask the pool for one. Right after we&quot;re done with it, we put it back. As a consequence, we won&rsquo;t require to allocate memory every time we need a fancy explosion since the pool will be created during launch.</p>
<p>Luckily enough, libgdx provides the Pool abstract class and the Poolable interface to achieve this behavior (had we seen ourselves in the need to come up with an implementation, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been the end of the world either).</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>abstract public class Pool {
	public Pool ();
	public Pool (int initialCapacity);
	public Pool (int initialCapacity, int max);

	abstract protected T newObject ();

	public T obtain ();
	public void free (T object);
	public void freeAll (Array objects);
	public void clear ();

	static public interface Poolable {
		public void reset ();
	}
}
</code></pre><p>As you can probably deduce after reading the previous snippet, in order to make a resource poolable it&rsquo;s required to implement the reset() method of such interface. Then you need to create a new <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/utils/Pool.html">Pool</a> class that implements the newObject() method which means the poolable object must provide a default constructor. Easy peasy. However, if by any chance you come across any problems while implementing this yourself, take a look at the official documentation or at this <a href="http://www.ziggysgames.com/my-weapon-bullet-system-using-artemis-and-libgdx-box2d">sample to have efficient bullets</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/freegemas/freegemas-03.png" alt="/img/freegemas/freegemas-03.png"></p>
<p>For those who remain skeptic, I used the libgdx ParticleEffectPool class in Freegemas to enhance efficiency with noticeable improvements in mobile devices. Every time you connect a group of 3 or more gems you get a sparkle effect right away. Even though this can be found in the Freegemas game state class implementation, I&quot;ll attach the interesting bits below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Create prototype effect
ParticleEffect effect = new ParticleEffect();
effect.load(Gdx.files.internal(&quot;data/particleStars&quot;), Gdx.files.internal(&quot;data&quot;));

// Create effects pool using thay prototype
ParticleEffectPool effectPool = new ParticleEffectPool(effect, 20, 100);
// Add new effect and enable it
ParticleEffect effect = effectPool.obtain();
effect.start();

// Put effect back in pool (first check if it has finished)
if (effect.isComplete()) {
	effectPool.free(effect);
}
</code></pre><p>Here we go, GC friendly particles. Neat, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<h3 id="still-in-trouble-do-some-profiling">Still in trouble? Do some profiling</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Alright, I&quot;m pretty sure your advice is utter bullshit, my app is still laggy! I want my money back.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/visualvm.png" alt="visualvm-300x187.png"></p>
<p>Before throwing that rotten tomato you&quot;re waving in anger, please consider giving profiling a shot. Get VisualVM, make it analyze your game while it&rsquo;s running and take a close look at the results. You might find out that a seemingly harmless method is consuming an obscene amount of CPU time. Who knows, perhaps you&rsquo;ve missed several memory allocations within the game loop. Despite of its simplicity, yes, I will tackle profiling with depth further ahead in this very same blog.</p>
<p>Promise.</p>

      <blockquote>
<p>Hang on a second… An art article written by a programmer? How do you dare? This is madness</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Well yes, so deal with it.</p>
<p>Life is hard for us programmers, who can&rsquo;t always find a committed artist (rare species) to work with in our projects. Yet we stand as heroes, eager to create games. It saddens me how often we see ourselves forced to produce low quality assets, I&quot;d never call that art. Actually, it&rsquo;s more appropriate to address them as utter crap. Cry no more, fellow coder, because it&rsquo;s all about workflow.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/happy-coder.png" alt="happy-coder.png"></p>
<blockquote>
<p>Are you telling me I can create decent looking characters and environments? But I suck at drawing!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Indeed, you probably do suck at drawing, just as much as I do. However, you&quot;d be surprised about how much can be achieved with a few tricks, the right tools and an a sensible scope. Please, do yourself a favour and abandon the idea of creating cutting edge 3D, hyper realistic characters and stick with more simple, colourful and cartoon 2D elements. With a considerably small time investment, you&quot;ll be able to make games that don&rsquo;t look as if they were created with Ye Olde Microsoft Paint. No eyes have to bleed anymore! Yay!</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/sad-mr-ms-paint.png" alt="sad-mr-ms-paint.png"></p>
<p>In order to get to where I now stand, I&rsquo;ve had to go through a lengthy and painful try/error process. Maybe I can spare you some, that&quot;d be nice, wouldn&rsquo;t it? Here&rsquo;s a disclaimer though, this is one of the many ways of doing things. I&quot;m sure a real artist would kick me in the balls upon such an insult to his profession, but hey, it has worked for me so far. Just check <a href="../../games/ld24-evolution-postmortem/">Evolution, my Ludum Dare #24 entry</a>. Hideous playability but decent looking for a 48h jam. I&quot;m going to use it as an example throughout the article, feel free to grab any ideas you fancy, add your own and ditch the rest.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/ld24/evolution-caveman-03.jpg" alt="evolution-caveman-03-300x168.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="the-initial-sketch">The initial sketch</h3>
<p>Firstly, let&rsquo;s make the assumption we&quot;re working on a character for our game, although this could perfectly apply to environments as well. The very first step is to draw a basic sketch on paper. I&quot;m fully aware that drawing on paper in a world of graphic tablets might strike some people as old school. Nevertheless, paper is just simpler and cheaper, a good fit for our purposes.</p>
<p>A rule of thumb would be to stick to basic shapes, keeping in mind at all times a lovely cartoon style. Trying to emulate reality will surely result in disaster, in turn, shamelessly making things look funny could easily save the day. Don&rsquo;t worry if you can&rsquo;t go any further than poor stick men, you stand a good chance by choosing minimalistic designs. Look at De Blob&rsquo;s main character! It&rsquo;s basically made out of stylized circles and rectangles. Yet all the critics said it&rsquo;s a visually interesting game. Simplicity is your friend, embrace it and it&quot;ll hide your lack of talent.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/deblob.png" alt="deblob.png"></p>
<p>Once you&rsquo;ve finished your sketch, it&rsquo;s time for you to scan it. In the absence of a proper scanner, you can always take a picture. Don&rsquo;t worry if it&rsquo;s your phone&rsquo;s camera, we&quot;ll only use it as a reference so that&quot;ll suffice.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/caveman-sketch.jpg" alt="caveman-sketch.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="lets-talk-vectors">Let&rsquo;s talk vectors</h3>
<p>Hold on, don&rsquo;t go fire up Photoshop CS [insert version number here] just yet! That won&rsquo;t be necessary. We&quot;re going to adopt a vector based approach using the open source solution <a href="http://inkscape.org/">Inkscape</a>. Beware! For the beautiful math behind <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%A9zier_curve">Bezier curves</a> shall serve us as disguise for our lame sketch. Elegant and stylized lines, simple shapes and the colourful palette. I love it.</p>
<p>Now it&rsquo;s a good time to mention that my workflow has been highly influenced by the <a href="http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.co.uk/">2D game art for programmers</a> blog, which provides numerous techniques to easily create assets using this sweet piece of software. Seriously, if you want to get started with this tool, check it out now. When I went through his very first tutorial, which only consists of making a funny looking alien face, I couldn&rsquo;t but be amazed at the ridiculous effort/outcome ratio.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/2d-game-art-for-programmers.png" alt="2d-game-art-for-programmers.png"></p>
<p>The principle behind this process only requires a little bit of practice. We programmers, love algorithms, so I&quot;ll explain all you need to know using a Python like pseudo code snippet.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>import Inkscape
import Awesomeness

# Open Inkscape
inkscape = Inkscape.newDocument()

# Prepare the awesomeness (patience and practice)
awesomeness = Awesomeness.bringItOn()

# Create a layer and import our sketch, use it as a guide
sketchLayer = inkscape.createLayer(&quot;sketch&quot;)
sketchLayer.loadBitmap(&quot;sketch.png&quot;)

# For every movable part in our character (further animation)
# Create a layer and draw it using vectors following the guide
for part in character.parts():
    partLayer = inkscape.createLayer(part)
    partLayer.setAlpha(0.5)
    awesomeness.drawBodyPartUsingGuide(sketchLayer, partLayer)

# You should really save in between too, just in case 🙂
inkscape.saveDocument(&quot;character.svg&quot;)
</code></pre><p>Now we&quot;re talking, aren&rsquo;t we? That&rsquo;s right, create a layer for every animated body part in your character, say head, torso, legs, feet, arms… The granularity depends on the desired level of movement detail. However I&quot;d advise you to keep it simple at first. Set the layer alpha transparency to something less than 1.0 so you can see your reference underneath it. Now listen, this might sound trickier than it really is, you just need to practice. Use circle or rectangle elements to model your character&rsquo;s body parts, convert them to paths and work with the Bezier nodes to adjust the shapes to the correspondent outline. If you&quot;re just staring at the screen with no idea of what I&quot;m talking about, please go to <a href="http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.co.uk/">2D game art for programmers</a>, follow the first articles and you&quot;ll see the light.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/caveman-outline.jpg" alt="caveman-outline.jpg"></p>
<p>Having finished the basic outline, you can start worrying about colour. Use bright but not too intense tones and the result will be noticeably better. Things like (0, 0, 255) for blue are strictly forbidden. A good idea is to grab some image as a reference and copy the colours, or use some of the multiple web design oriented palette creators out there.</p>
<p>Moving onto shading. You&quot;ll excuse me for redirecting you once more to <a href="http://2dgameartforprogrammers.blogspot.co.uk/">2D game art for programmers</a>. There you can get ahold of some basic shading techniques, believe me, some shine here and a shadow there, will completely transform your creation. As far as I&quot;m aware, the principle is straightforward. Position an imaginary light source in your scene and try to figure out, with a minimalistic approach in mind, how would it affect your newly born creation. Add more bezier magic and paint it slightly brighter or darker than the base. Iterate, play with it until you&quot;re satisfied.</p>

<h3 id="3-2-1-action">3, 2, 1… Action!</h3>
<p>Depending on the game you have in mind, you might not need animations at all! In that case your character would be perfectly ready for production use (happy face). Otherwise, you&quot;ll need to export every body part as a separate PNG file. The size doesn&rsquo;t really matter but it&rsquo;s preferable to overshoot the resolution rather than falling short, downscaling algorithms are decent nowadays. Rest assured, once you export the first part, Inkscape will keep the aspect ratio and proportions of all the others.</p>
<p>We could animate our character by moving all its parts little by little and exporting every frame by hand from Inkscape itself, although it pains me just to think about it. So tedious! Instead, we&quot;ll use some 2D animation software to set keyframes with different poses so its tweening engine can work out the rest. Adobe Flash CS can easily do the job but if you&quot;re looking for an inexpensive solution, <a href="http://www.synfig.org/cms/">Synfig studio</a> is worth checking out. Last time I took a look, it lacked features but our requirements are more than covered with either.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/caveman-flash.jpg" alt="caveman-flash.jpg"></p>
<p>Regardless of your choice, the algorithm here is simple too! We&quot;ll explain a walking cycle as an example. Proceed as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Import each body part in a different layer.</li>
<li>1st keyframe: configure the parts so the character stays in an idle pose.</li>
<li>2nd keyframe: character with its right leg and arm aiming forward while the left arm and leg are left behind.</li>
<li>3rd keyframe: back to idle pose.</li>
<li>4th keyframe: a reverse version of the second keyframe.</li>
<li>5th keyframe: back to idle.</li>
<li>Create motion tweens between keyframes, the software will fill in the gaps.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/caveman-walking-cycle.gif" alt="caveman-walking-cycle.gif"></p>
<p>You&quot;d be surprised at the amount of existing literature on walking cycles and I know I&quot;m not being accurate, but this could get you started. Decomposing movement in keyframes is not easy peasy. Nevertheless, you should always try to avoid visual fidelity. Look at games like Super Mario, they&quot;re extremely simplistic and full of metaphors. Mario&rsquo;s jumping animation could have three frames and still looks good! They don&rsquo;t try to model reality, they don&rsquo;t need to and neither do you.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/mario-jump.png" alt="mario-jump.png"></p>
<p>When you export the resulting animations you&quot;ll probably get a ton of individual PNG images which will make your engine very sad.</p>
<h3 id="create-your-sprite-sheet">Create your sprite sheet</h3>
<p>Animated characters are usually stored as sprite sheets containing all frames of every animation. Offtimes, you&quot;ll come across with several characters gathered in a big sprite sheet. This reduces file access times and makes rendering a lot faster because you don&rsquo;t need to be switching between textures all the time. The renderer will draw different portions of the same texture lighting fast and everybody happy.</p>

<p>Does that mean I need to merge the countless PNGs by hand?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Luckily, we can count on the wonderful <a href="http://code.google.com/p/libgdx-texturepacker-gui/">Libgdx TexturePacker GUI</a> to do the job. It&rsquo;s free, open source and dead easy to use it. It has a few parameters you can play with, but nothing complex. Grab it and create your awesome sprite sheet.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-it">This is it!</h3>
<p>Oh boy that was a long article! Since it took me a long time to figure this out, I thought it was worth sharing some of that experience with my fellow coders. It&quot;d be truly awesome if someone left a comment saying how wrong I am along a suggestion on how to improve my art &ldquo;algorithm&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Until next time fellas!</p>

      <p>The HTML5 version of Freegemas is a project I&rsquo;ve wanted to get around to finish for a long time. Finally, it greatly pleases me to say, it&rsquo;s done and you can play it right here, right now.</p>
<h3 id="play-freegemasfreegemas"><a href="../../freegemas/">Play Freegemas</a></h3>
<p>Freegemas HTML5 runs on any browser that supports WebGL. If you&quot;re an unlucky Internet Explorer user, you then deserve to be deprived of the joys Freegemas has to offer. Anyways! As some of you may already know, my work here consisted in simply porting <a href="http://code.google.com/p/freegemas/">the original Gosu game</a> to Java and libgdx so it&quot;d run on JVM desktops and Android. At that point in time, libgdx HTML5 support was on the works which explains why there wasn&rsquo;t a browser release in the first place. Luckily enough, this is not the case anymore.</p>
<p>With libgdx&rsquo;s magical GWT backend up and running, deploying the WebGL version wasn&rsquo;t too much of a headache. Nevertheless, I&quot;ll shamelessly count it as my <a href="../../games/one-game-a-month/">#OneGameAMonth</a> January project. Truth be told, I did improve performance quite a bit after taking a look at the VisualVM profiling tool, which will feed a future article. If my current knowledge of the Java language is poor to say the least, when I first released Freegemas, it was just hideous. As a consequence, memory allocation was running a bit wild.</p>
<p>Improvements summary:</p>
<ul>
<li>Performance improvements</li>
<li>Fixed crash in board check</li>
<li>Added German language (thanks to <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/memberlist.php?mode=viewprofile&amp;u=1697">just4phil</a> for that <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/freegemas-gdx/pull/1">pull request</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Enjoy.</p>

<p>Your quest is to try to create one new game each month. This challenge is meant to help you on a personal level. There are no prizes, signup fees or rules. It might sound crazy optimistic, but you CAN do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/onegameamonth.jpg" alt="onegameamonth.jpg"></p>
<p>These are the opening lines on the <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One Game A Month</a> website, an initiative by Christer Kaitila aka <a href="https://twitter.com/McFunkypants">@McFunckypants</a> (author of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/game-jam-survival-guide/book">The Game Jam Survival Guide</a>). I came across this insane quest just over a week ago and I&rsquo;ve given it a lot of thought before accepting it. No doubt, it&rsquo;s a ton of work but it could have an immensely big educational power if used right. By definition, it gives you 12 attempts to try completely new things!</p>
<p>I sincerely believe it to be an accomplishable task, providing that each game is not over scoped. Taking into account weekends away, important events and workload at the office won&rsquo;t be easy, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I shouldn&rsquo;t try! Hell, may this post serve as a shameful proof of my failure shall that come to happen. The fact that game jams, ports and prototypes count, will certainly make the process less painful.</p>
<p>Conveniently, this comes at a time when I wanted to try learn new things such as AI techniques or some graphics programming (which I, shamefully, know nothing about). One Game A Month could be seen as the perfect way of keeping myself engaged and highly motivated.</p>
<p>Motivation! This ties with the super awesome online platform on which One Game A Month is built. <a href="https://twitter.com/McFunkypants">@McFunckyPants</a> has shipped some sort of gamification system where the user creates a profile an earns experience points by submitting games and helping other people out. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a gamedev partner search system where participants can look for registered coders/artists to team up with. I was amazed at the massive amount of work put into this for pure gamedev love. Thanks a lot for that! The Twitter community is also strong and the retweet bot makes it easy to meet new people and their projects.</p>
<p>Like I said, I love it! It&rsquo;s pure community spirit.</p>
<p>There will be news on the January project soonish. In the meantime, I&quot;ll just leave you with the keynote video.</p>
