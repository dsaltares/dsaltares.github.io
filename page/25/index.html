      <blockquote>
<p>Your quest is to try to create one new game each month. This challenge is meant to help you on a personal level. There are no prizes, signup fees or rules. It might sound crazy optimistic, but you CAN do it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/onegameamonth.jpg" alt="onegameamonth.jpg">

</p>
<p>These are the opening lines on the <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One Game A Month</a> website, an initiative by Christer Kaitila aka <a href="https://twitter.com/McFunkypants">@McFunckypants</a> (author of <a href="http://www.packtpub.com/game-jam-survival-guide/book">The Game Jam Survival Guide</a>). I came across this insane quest just over a week ago and I&rsquo;ve given it a lot of thought before accepting it. No doubt, it&rsquo;s a ton of work but it could have an immensely big educational power if used right. By definition, it gives you 12 attempts to try completely new things!</p>
<p>I sincerely believe it to be an accomplishable task, providing that each game is not over scoped. Taking into account weekends away, important events and workload at the office won&rsquo;t be easy, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean I shouldn&rsquo;t try! Hell, may this post serve as a shameful proof of my failure shall that come to happen. The fact that game jams, ports and prototypes count, will certainly make the process less painful.</p>
<p>Conveniently, this comes at a time when I wanted to try learn new things such as AI techniques or some graphics programming (which I, shamefully, know nothing about). One Game A Month could be seen as the perfect way of keeping myself engaged and highly motivated.</p>
<p>Motivation! This ties with the super awesome online platform on which One Game A Month is built. <a href="https://twitter.com/McFunkypants">@McFunckyPants</a> has shipped some sort of gamification system where the user creates a profile an earns experience points by submitting games and helping other people out. Furthermore, there&rsquo;s a gamedev partner search system where participants can look for registered coders/artists to team up with. I was amazed at the massive amount of work put into this for pure gamedev love. Thanks a lot for that! The Twitter community is also strong and the retweet bot makes it easy to meet new people and their projects.</p>
<p>Like I said, I love it! It&rsquo;s pure community spirit.</p>
<p>There will be news on the January project soonish. In the meantime, I&quot;ll just leave you with the keynote video.</p>

      <p>Creative people usually make a big deal out of authorship and honestly, who can blame us? We&quot;re passionate about our work! Producing something that doesn&rsquo;t entirely suck entails sweat, tears and numerous sleepless nights. The open source world is inherently tricky and raises many concerns regarding ownership.</p>
<h3 id="open-source-is-a-tradeoff">Open source is a tradeoff</h3>
<p>The story of our lives isn&rsquo;t it? Making your project open source is a tradeoff. On one hand you are more likely to achieve certain level of exposure. You&quot;ll ask questions on StackOverflow, publish your progress under the showcase category of the engine you&quot;re using and chat with other devs on an IRC channel. Being active in a community where people share their love in source code shape is wonderful and enriching. Who knows? Maybe a prospective employer thinks your coding style is &ldquo;elegant&rdquo; after browsing your online repository. True story.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it&rsquo;s understandable to fear hosting your code where it can be checked out by anyone and be claimed as theirs. Especially knowing they could shamelessly use it for commercial purposes even though your license explicitly forbids it. Horror stories where interviewers found out their candidates were presenting someone else&rsquo;s code as theirs are widely known. Yes, shame on them!</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/show-me-the-source-yoda.jpg" alt="show-me-the-source-yoda.jpg">

</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s first assume your rent doesn&rsquo;t depend on people buying what you make. Unless you have an alternative business model such as providing an additional service, logic would slap you in the face. However, if this is something you&quot;re making to boost your portfolio or just for fun, read on and you&quot;ll find a few ways of making sure you keep the ownership of anything you publish, absent doubts.</p>
<p>After taking some precautions, making open source software really pays off.</p>
<h3 id="attach-the-license">Attach the license</h3>
<p>First of all, you must make clear which license your code sweetness is published under. A good practice is to attach an <a href="http://www.gnu.org/prep/maintain/html_node/Recording-Contributors.html">AUTHORS</a> along a LICENSE file in the main folder of the repo. Even though many people overlook this, every single file of code should contain a header summarizing that license. Shall we look at Sion Tower as an example of project published under <a href="http://gplv3.fsf.org/">GPL 3</a>? Here&rsquo;s its <a href="https://forja.rediris.es/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/siontower/trunk/src/LICENSE?root=cusl5-iberogre&amp;view=markup">LICENSE</a> file and the beginning of the <a href="https://forja.rediris.es/plugins/scmsvn/viewcvs.php/siontower/trunk/src/include/collisionManager.h?root=cusl5-iberogre&amp;rev=238&amp;view=markup">CollisionManager.h</a> file.</p>

</code></pre><p>Obviously, you don&rsquo;t need to use GPL 3 necessarily, just make sure you attach the corresponding text of your license of choice.</p>
<p>License? Check.</p>
<p>Some people couldn&rsquo;t care less about software licenses, fair enough. So… Shall we move on to the next point?</p>
<h3 id="run-away-from-dropbox-use-a-version-control-system">Run away from Dropbox! Use a version control system</h3>
<p>Possibly, the most important golden rule of all is to keep track of your work&rsquo;s history. If you host your code in Dropbox and then share the link, you&quot;re doomed. The second someone asks for proof you&rsquo;ve written it, you&quot;ll have to go home and cry. The answer is simple, use version control. To be honest, why the hell wouldn&rsquo;t you be doing that anyway  Let&rsquo;s put flame wars aside, SVN, Git, Mercurial or any other would be perfectly valid. Backups are built in, you can revert changes and what matters to us now, you get a full history of everything that&rsquo;s happened.</p>
<p>I know for a fact that employees check your projects&quot; history to prevent people stealing code from other sources without even knowing what they&quot;re doing. Being able to reuse and adapt code is excellent and it&rsquo;s highly appreciated, but you need to roughly understand what you&quot;re dealing with.</p>
<p>

</p>
<h3 id="write-a-dev-blog">Write a dev blog</h3>
<p>Finally, it&quot;d be a brilliant idea to write a development blog where you explain your progress. Not only it serves as a backup log, it&rsquo;s the ultimate proof you fully understand the details of the problem being tackled. Actually, it&rsquo;s beneficial for so many other reasons as it also reinforces the impact your project has in the community and increases your online presence. Key facts.</p>
<p>In my humble opinion, sharing your code can bring you happiness in form of acknowledgement, personal enrichment and, why not, professional success. You just need to be aware of the caveats and take reasonable precautions.</p>

      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Dec 30, 2012 &middot; 3 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/games/new-to-games-just-make-games/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>

      </span>
      
      <p><span style="color: #ff0000;">Disclaimer</span>: this text is aimed at games programming beginners.</p>
<p>Diving into games development for the first time is exciting but offtimes confusing, a great piece of advice would be: just make games. Get things done, period. I&rsquo;ve often found myself researching which available technology would suit my requirements best, as if I needed a sophisticated tailored tuxedo. The fear of finding a dead end was as powerful as counterproductive. Such a time wasting approach.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>What&rsquo;s the most powerful games framework out there? Should I learn a new language to start making games?</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Stop it.</p>
<p>Needless to say, you&quot;ll make mistakes along the way and that is not a stigma we&quot;re going to get rid off anytime soon. When I was working on my <a href="../../games/sion-tower/">final degree project</a>, I happened to realize quite often I needed to rewrite a whole subsystem from scratch (sad face) but that&rsquo;s part of the learning process. Spending weeks going through feature lists of well advertised frameworks you most likely don&rsquo;t understand isn&rsquo;t. Take this as a piece of advice to help you stay focused on what really matters, creating games.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/sion-tower/siontower-game11.png" alt="siontower-game11.png">

</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle">KISS</a> (Keep It Simple, Stupid) is a principle to live by.</p>
<p>This field&rsquo;s learning curve is steep enough for us to try complicate things any further. If you&quot;re already half decent in a certain language, don&rsquo;t try to learn a new one with the sole purpose of using a specific engine. Beware! It&rsquo;s dauntingly easy to fall for this.</p>
<p>A couple Google or Stack Overflow queries will suffice to discover a suitable game engine that gets along with your language of choice. Be almost certain that it&quot;ll feature everything you need and more. If you think that being able to use the latest computer graphics algorithm is important, you&quot;re wrong. Tetris, R-Type, Snake and the like are encouraged as first projects and they don&rsquo;t need to be fancy at all. Once again, put everything else aside and push forward to complete it.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/pong.jpeg" alt="pong.jpeg">

</p>
<p>After finishing a couple of small projects you should ask yourself the following: are you in this for fun? In that case, you can stick with the environment you&quot;re most comfortable with. Keep producing awesome games, no pressure! However, you might be aiming at making a living out of it. When the latter applies, learn new languages to broaden your skill set bearing in mind that proficiency in C++ is paramount.</p>
<p>Summarizing, unless you code in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck">Brainfuck</a>, there are plenty of valid tools that will provide you with more power than you could possibly use.</p>
<ul>
<li>C: <a href="http://www.libsdl.org/">SDL</a></li>
<li>C++: <a href="http://www.sfml-dev.org/">SFML</a></li>
<li>Python: <a href="http://www.pygame.org/news.html">PyGame</a></li>
<li>Java: <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a></li>
<li>Ruby: <a href="http://www.libgosu.org/">Gosu</a></li>
<li>Flash: <a href="http://flashpunk.net/">Flashpunk</a></li>
<li>Lua: <a href="https://love2d.org/">Love2D</a></li>
<li>PHP: are you kidding me?</li>
</ul>
<p>Still skeptical? Examine the showcase forum of each one of them, you&quot;d be surprised.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/vampire-runner.jpg" alt="vampire-runner.jpg">

</p>
<p>Actually, the only thing to be concerned about is whether the candidate is well documented and counts with an active community or not. Watch out for niche and cryptic technology. Fortunately, those are easily to spot by paying their online platform a quick visit. Excellent, now you will enjoy the wonders of a helpful bunch of fellow coders when you get stuck.</p>
<p>Wrapping things up, are you still desperately looking for the ultimate panacea? Don&rsquo;t worry too much and just make games.</p>

      <p>A friend recently asked me about which either general or games specific programming books would I recommend. The true and legendary must read. I answered him directly as I was feeling lazy about posting a comment on each one of them but here I am now. Nevertheless, before going straight to the list, please bare in mind that just like any other best of [<em>insert year here</em>] collection, this is simply a matter of opinion. Not every book is necessarily suitable for everyone at any given time.</p>
<h3 id="effective-c">Effective C++</h3>
<p>Provided you already know how to code in C/C++ reasonably well, this is the book you should be looking at. Proficiency is in the details and you want to get better, don&rsquo;t you? Structured in small pieces of advice, makes it highly entertaining and almost hides the complexity of the dense topics it covers. Contents range from subtle language details to design gems and wise use of OOP, it has a little bit of everything and I love it. The best non basic C++ book I have ever read, absent doubt.</p>
<p>If you want to go further, <em>More Effective C++</em> and <em>Effective STL</em> are worth checking out as well.</p>
<h3 id="design-patterns">Design Patterns</h3>
<p>I read this one a few years ago and it has proven itself most helpful since then. It is the classic patterns book, elegantly designed solutions to common problems. Singleton, facade, factory and all their friends are explained by presenting a real life problem, discussing a few alternatives to finally come up with a beautiful approach to solve it. Patterns are widely used in companies and, I believe knowing how to employ them wisely is paramount to be a good coder. As it is also an item structured book, it becomes quite accessible and allows being used as a consult source.</p>
<h3 id="game-engine-architecture">Game Engine Architecture</h3>
<p>Personally, I consider it the ultimate game programming Bible. Brilliantly written by a Naughty Dog coder, it goes through every single component a decent game engine has. Input, rendering, collision detection, AI, networking and many others are there. Not only it explains what every subsystem does and a few ways of implementing each one of them, it also details how subsystems cooperate to achieve the bigger goal. Even though it does not provide an excessive amount of sample code, it hints enough so a mere commoner coder like me can implement stuff and feel fairly smart afterwards.</p>
<p>However, I would not recommend it as a first contact with game development, being so massive and detailed, it can blow any newcomer&rsquo;s mind.</p>
<h3 id="game-programming-gems">Game Programming Gems</h3>
<p>This one is actually a series of books, very well known if I may add so it will not strike you as a surprise. Each issue is made of several articles written by industry professionals on themed blocks. I read a few when I was a complete noob so my ability to absorb knowledge from them was quite limited to put it nicely. As opposed to Game Engine Architecture, which scratches the surface of many topics, these texts are highly specific and therefore, recommended for medium to advanced programmers. This is the real deal, profusely tested and used in tangible projects.</p>
<h3 id="artificial-intelligence-for-games">Artificial Intelligence for Games</h3>
<p>Want to learn about game AI? Search no more because this is it. Very few books start covering the very basics about an artificial intelligence system and end up explaining quite advanced stuff such as space partitioning, hierarchical path finding and machine learning. Even though it warms up with a friendly vision of how AI systems are designed and layered, it turns to be absolutely right and precise. Movement, physics, steering behaviors, state machines, high level strategies, decision making, you name it, the book explains it in plain English and easy to digest Python like pseudo-code.</p>
<p>I read it from cover to end only to find out later that it was going to be the course book for the AI module I took in Kingston University.</p>
<p>Currently I am reading through <em>Large Scale C++ Software Design</em> and it seems like a strong candidate for this list. I will probably write my impressions on it in the near future.</p>

      <p>I&rsquo;ve recently been to Spain, not only to spend some quality time with family and friends but to deliver a presentation at my home University. It was basically about how the Games Industry work, how we make games at Crytek UK and what should a Computing Science student do in order to find a job in such a field. Anyways, it was quite nice coming back to where all this began and I&quot;d like to thank my professor Manuel Palomo for making this possible.</p>
<p>
  <img src="../../img/wp/crytek-uca-talk.jpg" alt="crytek-uca-talk.jpg">

</p>
<p>To be honest, it shocked me to see a conference room full of people with even some crazy individuals standing at the back to listen to whatever nonsense I had to say. I got some positive feedback in person and over Twitter so that made me quite happy and stop thinking I bored everyone to death.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been asked several times if it was possible to share the slides and after getting my bosses approval here they are. I guess they lose part of the charm without the talking part but hey, it&rsquo;s better than nothing isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
