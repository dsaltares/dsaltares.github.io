      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Sep 8, 2012 &middot; 3 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/games/abstracting-platform-specific-code-in-libgdx/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="../../categories/games-development">Games development</a>
      </span>
      
      <p>One of the main reasons I&quot;m working with <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a> is its multiplatform capabilities. With very little effort you can target desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Android and WebGL able browsers. The problem comes with the <em>&ldquo;little&rdquo;</em> in the previous sentence. The developer is supposed to share the code base between all targets but sometimes it&quot;s necessary to provide platform specific behaviour, maybe because a feature is not available in every device or just to adapt the product better to the target. Anyway, how do we achieve that in a fairly elegant fashion?</p>
<h3 id="project-structure">Project structure</h3>
<p>As many of you may already know, a multiplatform libgdx project is often arranged the following way:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>game</strong>: shared code base</li>
<li><strong>game-desktop</strong>: desktop launcher</li>
<li><strong>game-android</strong>: Android launcher</li>
<li><strong>game-html</strong>: HTML5 launcher</li>
</ul>
<p>Every platform specific project depends on the base one and they all instantiate the main class from there, typically belonging to an <code>ApplicationListener</code> derived class (we shall name it <em>Game</em> from now on). Yes, it is perfectly fine to add platform specific code in the derived projects. However, it would be desirable to handle platform specific behaviour using an homogeneous approach, from our base project.</p>
<h3 id="the-platformresolver-interface">The PlatformResolver interface</h3>
<p>This interface belongs to the shared code base and it contains methods to provide platform specific behaviour depending on our needs. Here there&quot;s just a very basic example but this interface could vary on a per game basis. A good idea would be to implement this class as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">Facade</a> providing access to platform specific subsystems such as input management or Facebook connectivity to mention a couple.</p>
<pre><code>public interface PlatformResolver {
    public String getDefaultLanguage();
    public FacebookAPI getFacebookAPI();
    public InputManager getInputManager();
}
</code></pre><p>Our main game class would hold an instance to a specific <em>PlatformResolver</em> yet to be determined. It&quot;s each platform&quot;s responsibility to tell the game which instance should it use to solve platform specific issues.</p>
<pre><code>public class Game implements ApplicationListener {
    protected static PlatformResolver m_platformResolver = null;

    public static PlatformResolver getPlatformResolver() {
        return m_platformResolver;
    }

    public static void setPlatformResolver(PlatformResolver platformResolver) {
        m_platformResolver = platformResolver;
    }
}
</code></pre><h3 id="platformresolver-in-use">PlatformResolver in use</h3>
<p>In each descendent project we would have something similar to:</p>
<pre><code>public class AndroidResolver implements PlatformResolver {}
public class DesktopResolver implements PlatformResolver {}
public class WebGLResolver implements PlatformResolver {}
</code></pre><p>Like I mentioned before, it&quot;s necessary to tell the <em>Game</em> which platform resolver to use, we do that in every platform&quot;s launcher. The desktop one could serve as a perfectly valid example:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args) {
    // Configure platform dependent code
    Game.setPlatformResolver(new DesktopResolver());

    // Launch the game
    new LwjglApplication(new Game(), cfg);
}
</code></pre><p>Later on during execution we could need to determine the system&quot;s default language but that depends on the platform we are working withâ€¦ Fear no more! We can happily ask our <em>PlatformResolver</em>:</p>
<pre><code>String defaultLang = Game.getPlatformResolver().getDefaultLanguage();
</code></pre><h3 id="the-possibilities">The possibilities</h3>
<p>We are currently using this very same approach for <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/sionengine">SionEngine</a> and it&quot;s proven to be flawless so far. You can abstract virtually any platform specific behaviour using something similar.</p>
<p>Soon there will be more and better on libgdx related stuff! Feel free to criticize and throw rocks at me because of this post.</p>

      <p>Note: I&rsquo;ve decided to remove the repo for now as I feel that it&rsquo;s still too rough around the edges. Other open source projects that share this codebase are, however, available on my <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares">GitHub profile</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/libgdx-glossy.png" alt="libgdx.png"></p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve been working with <strong><a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/">libgdx</a></strong> for a few months now and I love every aspect of it, except maybe the fact that it&rsquo;s only compatible with Java but don&rsquo;t worry about me, I&quot;ll survive. Being able to target desktop (Windows/Linux/Mac), Android and HTML5 with very little effort it&rsquo;s just too awesome. Beware GWT&rsquo;s dark magic though. Thing is I&rsquo;ve already made a couple of very small games with it (<a href="../../games/freegemas-for-android-and-html5/">Freegemas</a> and <a href="../../games/ld24-evolution-postmortem/">Evolution</a>) which has provided me with certain code base. Since it&rsquo;s not absolutely despicable rubbish I&rsquo;ve decided to push its development further as I make more games and, why not, make it open source.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/github_logo_social_coding_outlined.png" alt="github_logo_social_coding_outlined.png"></p>
<h3 id="github-repository">GitHub repository</h3>
<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve set up a <strong><a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/sionengine">GitHub repository for the so called SionEngine</a></strong>, feel free to check it out. However, as I&quot;m working on an incremental integration of my code base, it&rsquo;s a bit empty just now. I honestly don&rsquo;t expect people come and say, <em>&ldquo;oh this is awesome!&quot;</em> and use this system. It&rsquo;s just that I need somewhere to host it (preferably for free) and it&rsquo;s been proven that the open source approach forces me to write cleaner code and do things the proper way if there&rsquo;s such a thing.</p>
<p>For the past couple of years I&rsquo;ve been using Google Code mostly and I&rsquo;ve looked GitHub with a bit of skepticism but the idea of having every personal project centralized in one nice and clean place is quite appealing. Let&rsquo;s see how this goes, I might be moving older projects to my GitHub profile as well.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/libgdx-targets.png" alt="libgdx-targets.png"></p>
<h3 id="current-features">Current features</h3>
<p>Like I said, I&quot;m currently moving all the stuff to the GitHub repository so not everything is there just now. However, in the following days you should be able to find:</p>
<ul>
<li>Every libgdx feature, of course.</li>
<li>Reflection based multiplatform testing environment.</li>
<li>Simple internationalization support.</li>
<li>Stack based and memory safe state manager.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.aurelienribon.com/blog/projects/universal-tween-engine/">Universal Tween Engine</a> integration with some Tweeners built in.</li>
<li>In house entity component system (wich will be replaced by Artemis).</li>
<li>Animated sprites.</li>
<li><a href="http://box2d.org/">Box2D</a> integration.</li>
<li>XML based settings system.</li>
<li>Easy way of introducing seamless platform dependent code.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../img/ld24/evolution-caveman-03.jpg" alt="evolution-caveman-03.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="coming-soon">Coming soon</h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://gamadu.com/artemis/">Artemis Entity Framework</a> integration</li>
<li>Smooth transitions between states</li>
<li>Inkscape XML level loading.</li>
<li>Console to modify settings at runtime.</li>
<li>[Whatever feature I need for the project I might be working on at that moment and deserves to make its way to the engine code]</li>
</ul>
<p>I will probably post about the components in SionEngine as I commit them. That way I&quot;ll think about their design and implementation twice and maybe, just maybe, they might be helpful to somebody else. Just the ones that are not absolutely lame, of course. Still need to make a decision on the license!</p>

<p>Ludum Dare #24 is over after an exhausting crazy weekend but, above all, itÂ´s been a ton of fun. Joining the Dare has proven to be an excellent idea and I believe it&quot;d be right to say it&rsquo;s has not gone too bad after all, considering it was my first time. Here&rsquo;s a little postmortem on the experience.</p>
<h3 id="evolution--the-survival-of-the-fittest"><strong>Evolution â€“ The survival of the fittest</strong></h3>
<p>The competition&rsquo;s theme was Evolution so I went for a classic 2D platformer starred by a funny caveman who has to get through the level while killing dinosaurs by jumping on them or throwing rocks which he collects himself. Yes, I&quot;m aware I&quot;m not going to get many points for sticking to the theme.</p>
<p>Evolution is written in Java using the wonderful libgdx framework and my personal code base (which I made available prior to the Dare).</p>
<p><img src="../../img/ld24/evolution-caveman-01.jpg" alt="evolution-caveman-01.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="what-went-right"><strong>What went right</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Completion</strong>: I guess having delivered something at my first attempt it&rsquo;s a win, even though the game lacks in many aspects. Time management was not completely disastrous.</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Evolution has received very positive feedback art wise and being a programmer it feels a bit bizarre. The process followed to create and animate character was: sketching on paper, vectorizing and colouring with Inkscape, animation with Flash and Texture Packer to produce spritesheets. I&quot;ll keep working on this line.</li>
<li><strong>Multi platform</strong>: libgdx was a good decision, not only is a very nice and powerful framework but also allows to target several platforms with no to very little effort.</li>
<li><strong>Box2D</strong>: using this popular physics engine empowered me to implement the basic movement through the level extremely quickly.</li>
<li><strong>Code base</strong>: although I discovered a fair amount of bugs in my code base, it behaved quite nicely. I also got a ton of ideas to improve it.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../img/ld24/evolution-caveman-02.jpg" alt="evolution-caveman-02.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="what-went-wrong"><strong>What went wrong</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Gameplay polish</strong>: I didn&rsquo;t invest enough time to polish the gameplay, tweak values and play test the game and that reflects on the final build. It&rsquo;s a noob mistake and that makes me sad.</li>
<li><strong>Content</strong>: I decided to invest the last moments of the competition in the little polishing I did instead of content creation which resulted in having just one level. However, I think it was the right call, I simply didn&rsquo;t have time for everything.</li>
<li><strong>Asset pipeline</strong>: too much time was wasted in getting the export process right for some of the assets. On the bright side, I&rsquo;ve learnt a lot and it won&rsquo;t happen next time.</li>
<li><strong>HTML5 port</strong>: it would have been awesome to have a browser version of my game with no third party plugins requirements so people could just play. Too bad my HTML5 port had a bad crash.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../img/ld24/evolution-caveman-03.jpg" alt="evolution-caveman-03.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="conclusions"><strong>Conclusions</strong></h3>
<p>I can&rsquo;t stress enough how awesome of an experience it was. So many emotions mixed in the pot: stress, joy, thrill, exhaustion and so many more. I learned so much and felt great for having been able to deliver something in such a short timespan. I will definitely try to be in next time.</p>
<p>Looking forward to get more feedback during the voting phase, best of luck to all my fellow Ludum Darers!</p>

<p>This weekend I&quot;ll be joining <a href="http://ludumdare.com/compo/">Ludum Dare</a> #24, the crazy 48h solo game making online competition. Pick the tools of your choice but everything has to be made from scratch, and according to a theme selected by the community through strict democracy. Last edition got over 1000 submissions, so it looks really promising. I&quot;m gathering with a couple of friends from work in some sort of LAN game jamming party and there will be food aplenty, fun times.</p>
<p>As I <a href="http://www.ludumdare.com/compo/2012/08/23/and-yet-another-im-in-post/">posted</a> on the official Ludum Dare blog, I&quot;ll be using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Language</strong>: Java using Eclipse as IDE.</li>
<li><strong>Libraries</strong>: libgdx and my personal <a href="https://dl.dropbox.com/u/1439807/siondream-engine.zip">code base</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Inkscape, Photoshop and Spriter (maybe).</li>
<li><strong>Audio</strong>: sfxr and Audacity.</li>
</ul>
<p>I honestly don&rsquo;t know what&rsquo;s gonna come out of this and I&quot;d be happy just to deliver something minimally playable by Sunday night. The plan is implementing every gameplay element with placeholders, then produce some mediocre art and finally polish whatever piece of rubbish entertainment experienced I&quot;d have created.</p>
<p>Like I said, at least it&quot;ll be fun and I&quot;m looking forward to test my work in progress framework in an almost real situation.</p>
<p>I shall keep you posted!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It&rsquo;s the sum total of every expressive media of all times made interactive, how is that not awesome!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I recently watched with a few friends <strong><a href="http://buy.indiegamethemovie.com/">Indie Game: The Movie</a></strong>, a documentary that shows the development process of a few independent small budget games and what drives their authors to work in such a competitive industry. I was fairly excited about watching it since the trailer highlighted <strong>some of the reasons I chose this career path</strong>. However, bare in mind that all that glitters is not gold.</p>
<p>Indie Game features three well known independent games being <a href="http://supermeatboy.com/">Super Meat Boy</a>, <a href="http://braid-game.com/">Braid</a> and <a href="http://fezgame.com/">Fez</a>. Their developers have proven themselves to be <strong>talented, creative people</strong> who took a ridiculously huge risk in order to do what they&quot;re truly passionate about: video games. That is definitely worth respect. However, I feel the necessity to point out the fact that not every game developer in the world is as those shown in the documentary.</p>
<p>They are generally normal, <strong>non tormented</strong>, cheerful people who don&rsquo;t have problems to socialize over a couple of beers. Most of them, actually, love beer. It&rsquo;s important to remark the line between medium/big studios where the mere commoners do not take the financial risk and the two people company who basically bet their future on its success. I&quot;d also be pretty stressed about it. Indie Game: The Movie is exclusively about the latter.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s good about this film is how <strong>it shows the passion and love</strong> these developers feel about what they do. You learn that, despite all the extenuating and brain melting crunching hours, the outcome of people having fun and experiencing all kinds of feelings with something you&rsquo;ve created is amazing. Of course there&rsquo;s also some people who like to play the misunderstood bohemian artist role, if you saw it already, you know what I&quot;m talking about [cough] Braid! [/cough].</p>
<p>Forget about my negative comments, Indie Game: The Movie is definitely worth a watch for several reasons. To know more about the making of a video game and to understand why their authors are so excited about them could be two good examples. Furthermore, it&rsquo;s very well put together, reasonably cheap ($10), comes completely DRM free, allows streaming, 1080p download version and includes subtitles.</p>
