      <p>It pleases me to say that this past week I&rsquo;ve been able to keep it real and stick to my humble set of tasks:</p>
<p><strong>Victory and defeat mechanic</strong>: the spaceship has a limited amount of energy which diminishes after each collision with the world geometry. Once it&rsquo;s empty, the game enters the defeat state and restarts. If the player manages to abduct all the astronauts in the level, the game goes into the victory state. The whole entity creation – deletion cycle has allowed me to spot some bugs and flaws in the entity system design, which is good.</p>
<p><strong>Placeholder HUD</strong>: I&rsquo;ve used the simple and yet powerful libgdx scene 2D elements to compose a minimalistic HUD which shows remaining astronauts, spaceship energy and elapsed time. Relax, it won&rsquo;t look this bad forever as the assets will be replaced by the final art in due time. I just wanted to get something functional.</p>
<p><strong>Improved control and abduction system</strong>: this is where I&rsquo;ve put most of the effort. Speed limits, collision restitution, impulses and so on have all been tweaked to make the spaceship control feel good. Luckily enough, I&rsquo;ve made it a lot smoother and pleasant, which was paramount to make the game fun. However, beware! For abducting all the astronauts shall not be an easy task.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/abduction.jpg" alt="abduction.jpg"></p>
<p>This week I&quot;ll be working on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refucktoring: some modules need a small cleanup.</li>
<li>Animated toasts: adding some effects for victory, defeat, abduction and collision situations.</li>
<li>Level system with locked/unlocked levels.</li>
</ul>

      <p>This hasn&rsquo;t been a particularly productive week for my One Game a Month quest. Luckily enough, it wasn&rsquo;t completely wasted as some stuff has, indeed, been done. Coding after work and taking care of so many other things it&rsquo;s unsurprisingly tough. I&quot;m still looking for that guy who sells hours, so I can append them to a regular day.</p>
<p>Except for the art, I pretty much did everything I promised. Actually, it&rsquo;s better if I make a game first and then worry about the art, as I learned from my <a href="../../games/ld24-evolution-postmortem/" title="LD#24 – Evolution Postmortem">Ludum Dare experience</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaceship with basic touch controls</li>
<li>Collisions</li>
<li>Camera following behavior</li>
<li>Astronauts basic abduction mechanic</li>
</ul>
<p>Here&rsquo;s a silly WIP video but, please, don&rsquo;t mind the art nor the general feeling. The spaceship movement needs a lot of tweaking.</p>

      <p>One week ago I posted about the <a href="../../games/1gam-february-game-design/">initial game design for my February One Game A Month entry</a>. I believe, it&rsquo;s time to report back with the work I&rsquo;ve done during the past seven days. Actually, I&rsquo;ve realised how good an incentive is to leave written proof of what you intend to do in advance, forcing yourself to deliver just to avoid the public humiliation.</p>
<h3 id="what-i-have-so-far">What I have so far</h3>
<p>Without further ado, here&rsquo;s the update.</p>
<ul>
<li>Started a <a href="https://github.com/dsaltares/rescuecopter">GitHub repo</a>.</li>
<li>Integrated my codebase with some improvements across the board: engine facade, ID generator, i18n support, animated sprites, physics objects.</li>
<li>Integrated the <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/tree/mapsapi/gdx/src/com/badlogic/gdx/maps">mapsapi libgdx branch</a> to do some further testing on my Gleed system. Found a bug and already <a href="https://github.com/libgdx/libgdx/pull/237">pull requested the fix</a>.</li>
<li>Component based entity system with an <a href="https://code.google.com/p/artemis-framework/">Artemis</a> like API but fully compatible with the GWT backend. Nice thing is, it enforces garbage collector friendliness (through entity and component pooling). I&quot;ll talk more about it on a different post.</li>
<li>Static bodies creation from map&rsquo;s shape data and material system. This might as well deserve another post, why the hell not!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/abduction-progress.jpg" alt="abduction-progress.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="coming-this-week">Coming this week</h3>
<p>I hereby make the compromise of delivering the following within a week.</p>
<ul>
<li>Spaceship entity with controls.</li>
<li>Camera movement behavior.</li>
<li>Collision handlers for the spaceship.</li>
<li>Foreground shapes set.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&rsquo;s leave it at that and stay realistic.</p>
<h3 id="and-now-for-something-completely-different">And now for something completely different</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve deleted my SionEngine repository from GitHub as I don&rsquo;t feel it meets the appropriate quality standards just yet. I will surely continue developing its components along every One Game a Month project, which, as you can see, will be open source too. I never pretended it to be a killer engine of any sort, this is just my codebase and a way of developing my software design skills.</p>
<p>See you guys next week.</p>

      <p>It&rsquo;s February already! What kind of madness is this? Anyhow, that means it&rsquo;s time to start working on this month&rsquo;s entry for <a href="http://www.onegameamonth.com/">One Game A Month</a> without further ado. This time I promise not to shamelessly make a port of an existing game and go for a brand new project instead. Shall this initial design article serve as the compromise I&quot;m making to see this game to completion.</p>
<p>I believe the following game concept to be simple enough for it to be achievable within a short month like February. Understandably, mechanics are very likely to change in case they don&rsquo;t work as initially thought. However I&rsquo;ve tried to keep the idea to it&rsquo;s bare minimum. Also, additional features will be included if there&rsquo;s a necessity and enough time for them.</p>
<h3 id="concept">Concept</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>The humans have invaded the planet you call home! All of a sudden there are all these conquest hungry astronauts wandering around. You must take your recon spaceship and abduct them all before it&rsquo;s too late!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/design-anotated.png" alt="design-anotated.png"></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, you control an alien in a small spaceship who must abduct every astronaut in each level in the minimum amount of time possible. In order to do so, you must position the ship over them for a certain amount of time, while the alien halo drags them up. Beware the rocky environment, you don&rsquo;t want to crash in the middle of the mission!</p>
<p>Level design would start quite simple with linear levels that test the player&rsquo;s skill controlling the spaceship. However, as the game progresses, things might get complicated. What seems to be a linear level could actually be some sort of maze with hidden astronauts requiring exploration.</p>
<h3 id="controls">Controls</h3>
<p>The player uses touch controls to pilot the spaceship across the level. Rather than using an unpopular virtual joystick, he&rsquo;s presented area controls. The steering force applied to the spaceship will be different depending on the touch position: up, left or right. It&rsquo;s worth mentioning that by touching the intersections, the player can make the ship ascend whilst moving towards a side.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/design-controls.png" alt="design-controls.png"></p>
<p>Piloting the spaceship has the additional difficulty of having to take into account inertia. If we let it descend for a while, it&quot;ll be quite hard to regain height. On the contrary, if we ascend too much, we&quot;ll inevitably crash as well.</p>
<h3 id="visuals">Visuals</h3>
<p>As explained in <a href="../../general/2d-character-creation-and-animation-for-dummies/"><em>&ldquo;2D character creation and animation… For dummies&rdquo;</em></a>, my lack of skill kind of forces me to go for a friendly cartoon style. No worries, that&rsquo;s fine because it matches the gameplay. It&rsquo;s clearly a casual arcade game with funny characters, so some colorful vector art will come very in handy.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>LibGDX will be the framework of choice and I&quot;ll try to keep the code as cross platform compatible as possible with the aim of targeting desktop, Android and HTML5. I&quot;ll be regularly posting updates!</p>

        <a href="https://saltares.com/games/beware-memory-allocation/">Beware memory allocation</a>
      </h1>
      <span class="post-date">Jan 29, 2013 &middot; 7 minute read &middot; <a href="https://saltares.com/games/beware-memory-allocation/#disqus_thread">Comments</a>
      
      <br/>
      <a class="label" href="../../categories/games-development">Games development</a>
      </span>
      
      <p>I bet you already know that keeping memory allocation under control in real time applications is absolutely essential. Bad memory management in non <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Garbage_collection_(computer_science)">garbage collected languages</a>, say C++, results in irresponsible footprints. $deity forbid we incur in a std::bad_alloc exception! That can be a deal breaker for mobile phones or consoles. However, the other family of languages is what really haunts me. In Java, for instance, the consequences of not giving a monkey&rsquo;s about memory won&rsquo;t necessarily make your game crash. Nonetheless, it can be silently devastating to the point of dragging your frame rate below ground absent previous notice.</p>
<p>You don&rsquo;t want that now, do you?</p>
<p>Please, let me take a step back and point out the irony of having to be extremely careful with memory usage in the presence of a garbage collector (GC) when dealing with real time problems. It&rsquo;s often said that it takes the responsibility off you. In a beautiful world where code tastes like lollipop it would, but this is really not the case. At least not entirely.</p>
<p>This article is aimed at developers who code in GC environments to make real time applications. Concepts here also apply to broader fields in spite of the focus mainly being Java and games development using the libgdx framework. Actually, I decided to write this post after seeing the same performance related questions <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=3572">over</a> and <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=11&amp;t=6785&amp;hilit=performance+garbage">over</a> again in the libgdx forums. Most of them are closely tied to memory allocation.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/wp/garbage-collector-strikes-back.jpg" alt="garbage-collector-strikes-back.jpg"></p>
<h3 id="be-aware-of-the-gc-and-why-its-critical-in-mobileconsoles">Be aware of the GC and why it&rsquo;s critical in mobile/consoles</h3>
<p>The GC is fired up every now and then and asks: <em>&ldquo;what objects are currently not being referenced by any variable?&quot;</em>. The next step is freeing the memory those objects were occupying so it becomes available for other purposes. It keeps the playground clean and neat and that&rsquo;s awesome to some extent. Surely enough, this might not cause too much trouble in classic applications. However, it can be deadly in a situation where you have less than 1/60s to compute a discrete simulation step.</p>
<p>Note: I just told a white lie. JVM&rsquo;s GC actually follows several strategies to free up unused memory as pointed out in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1582209/java-garbage-collector-when-does-it-collect">this Stack Overflow post</a>.</p>
<p>A common mistake, which I&rsquo;ve made myself with <a href="../../freegemas/">Freegemas</a>, is to believe my game is well optimized because it runs flawlessly on an i7 machine. Don&rsquo;t fool yourself, go on and deploy your libgdx app on a mid tier Android phone and see what happens.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh well… This is disappointing…</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mobile devices and consoles typically fall short on memory. You miss those 16GB of RAM, don&rsquo;t you? Moreover, every time the GC decides to intervene, the stall becomes more noticeable due to the less powerful CPU.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Oh noes!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Long story short, we need to prevent this from happening as much as we possibly can.</p>
<h3 id="cache-temporal-variables-as-data-members">Cache temporal variables as data members</h3>
<p>It goes without saying that some memory allocation is needed. Don&rsquo;t worry about loading your assets at sensible times as well as creating game objects to get things ready. Nevertheless, avoid making use of the new operator inside your game loop at any cost.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Sometimes I do need some auxiliary, yet costly, objects to perform calculations every frame.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Worry no more as you can make them private data members. As cheeky as it may sound, this will spare you a fair amount of problems.</p>
<p>I&quot;m currently working on a GLEED level system refactor and I think the renderer class could serve us as an perfect example. I use two Rectangle objects (Axis Aligned Bounding Boxes) to perform frustum culling: the first one represents the camera while the second one corresponds to the texture we might or might not render. Those two Rectangle objects don&rsquo;t naturally belong to the GLEEDMapRenderer themselves, but why would I allocate memory for new instances every single frame. That&quot;d make the GC sad. Instead, take a look at this simplified snippet.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>public class GleedMapRenderer implements MapRenderer, Disposable {

	// Renderer data
	private GleedMap m_map;
	private SpriteBatch m_batch;
	private boolean m_ownSpriteBatch;
	private float m_mpp;

	// Aux data for fustrum culling
	private Rectangle m_box = new Rectangle();
	private Rectangle m_camera = new Rectangle();

	public void render(OrthographicCamera camera) {
		m_camera.x = camera.position.x - camera.viewportWidth * 0.5f * camera.zoom;
		m_camera.y = camera.position.y - camera.viewportHeight * 0.5f * camera.zoom;
		m_camera.width = camera.viewportWidth *  camera.zoom;
		m_camera.height = camera.viewportHeight *  camera.zoom;

		setProjectionMatrix(camera.combined);

		MapLayers layers = m_map.getLayers();

		for (MapLayer layer : layers) {
			renderLayer(layer);
		}
	}

	private void renderLayer(MapLayer layer) {

		if (!layer.getVisible()) {
			return;
		}

		MapObjects objects = layer.getObjects();
		int numObjects = objects.getNumObjects();

		for (int j = 0; j &lt; numObjects; ++j) {
			MapObject mapObject = objects.getObject(j);

			if (mapObject == null || !mapObject.getVisible()) {
				continue;
			}

			if (!(mapObject instanceof TextureMapObject)) {
				continue;
			}

			TextureMapObject texture = (TextureMapObject)mapObject;

			setBounds(texture);

			// If the image is in the frustum, draw it (culling)
			if (m_camera.overlaps(m_box) ||
			    m_camera.contains(m_box) ||
			    m_box.contains(m_camera)) {

				...
			}
		}
	}
}
</code></pre><p>As illustrated above, the Rectangle instances are created along the renderer and properly set every frame. Consequently, what initially would have involved memory allocations, assignments and GC activity is reduced to just a few unavoidable assignments. Let&rsquo;s mention it once again, in spite of rectangles being cheap, you don&rsquo;t want to mess with the GC on mobile devices!</p>
<h3 id="consider-object-pooling">Consider object pooling</h3>
<p>Unfortunately, at some point you will find yourself in the need of constantly creating dozens of big sized objects. It&rsquo;s a common problem when dealing with spawning game entities, particle effects and the like. Say you&quot;re making a space shooter, of course you want hundreds of flashy explosions and lasers! You&quot;ll face a problem, that can drive the GC crazy as particles pop up or disappear.</p>
<p>Attention! The object pool game programming design pattern is on its way to rescue the programmer in distress!</p>
<p>I&quot;d encourage you to read through <a href="http://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/object-pool.html">this wonderful article</a> to get to know this common pattern. In brief, we basically keep a collection of pre-created objects (pool) that will be retrieved as necessary. We could have a pool with 1000 particle effects, every time we need an explosion in our game we just ask the pool for one. Right after we&quot;re done with it, we put it back. As a consequence, we won&rsquo;t require to allocate memory every time we need a fancy explosion since the pool will be created during launch.</p>
<p>Luckily enough, libgdx provides the Pool abstract class and the Poolable interface to achieve this behavior (had we seen ourselves in the need to come up with an implementation, it wouldn&rsquo;t have been the end of the world either).</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>abstract public class Pool {
	public Pool ();
	public Pool (int initialCapacity);
	public Pool (int initialCapacity, int max);

	abstract protected T newObject ();

	public T obtain ();
	public void free (T object);
	public void freeAll (Array objects);
	public void clear ();

	static public interface Poolable {
		public void reset ();
	}
}
</code></pre><p>As you can probably deduce after reading the previous snippet, in order to make a resource poolable it&rsquo;s required to implement the reset() method of such interface. Then you need to create a new <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/docs/api/com/badlogic/gdx/utils/Pool.html">Pool</a> class that implements the newObject() method which means the poolable object must provide a default constructor. Easy peasy. However, if by any chance you come across any problems while implementing this yourself, take a look at the official documentation or at this <a href="http://www.ziggysgames.com/my-weapon-bullet-system-using-artemis-and-libgdx-box2d">sample to have efficient bullets</a>.</p>
<p><img src="../../img/freegemas/freegemas-03.png" alt="/img/freegemas/freegemas-03.png"></p>
<p>For those who remain skeptic, I used the libgdx ParticleEffectPool class in Freegemas to enhance efficiency with noticeable improvements in mobile devices. Every time you connect a group of 3 or more gems you get a sparkle effect right away. Even though this can be found in the Freegemas game state class implementation, I&quot;ll attach the interesting bits below.</p>
<pre tabindex="0"><code>// Create prototype effect
ParticleEffect effect = new ParticleEffect();
effect.load(Gdx.files.internal(&quot;data/particleStars&quot;), Gdx.files.internal(&quot;data&quot;));

// Create effects pool using thay prototype
ParticleEffectPool effectPool = new ParticleEffectPool(effect, 20, 100);
// Add new effect and enable it
ParticleEffect effect = effectPool.obtain();
effect.start();

// Put effect back in pool (first check if it has finished)
if (effect.isComplete()) {
	effectPool.free(effect);

<h3 id="still-in-trouble-do-some-profiling">Still in trouble? Do some profiling</h3>

<p>Alright, I&quot;m pretty sure your advice is utter bullshit, my app is still laggy! I want my money back.</p>

<p>Before throwing that rotten tomato you&quot;re waving in anger, please consider giving profiling a shot. Get VisualVM, make it analyze your game while it&rsquo;s running and take a close look at the results. You might find out that a seemingly harmless method is consuming an obscene amount of CPU time. Who knows, perhaps you&rsquo;ve missed several memory allocations within the game loop. Despite of its simplicity, yes, I will tackle profiling with depth further ahead in this very same blog.</p>
<p>Promise.</p>
